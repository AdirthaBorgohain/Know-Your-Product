"Sometimes I stray from this cleanser, but I always come back. It takes off all makeup completely and leaves my skin feeling fresh and looking bright. The exfoliation is very, very gentle, and perfect for my slightly sensitive skin. It seems expensive, but because you need just a bit it lasts for a long, long time.",1
"I am a 41 year old African American woman with sign of hormonal aging. This product has my skin looking great, but you must use all of the other products for the full benefits.",1
"I'm really enjoying this product. Received a sample trio of the Murad products to try first, then purchased the cleanser. Great deal at $35 as a little goes a long way! I use it nightly with my Clarisonic Mia and in the morning by itself. Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth and appears to be helping to even out my skin tone.",1
"I tried this cleanser at a friends house, and I was instantly in love. I have combination skin, oily t-zone with flaky, dehydrated patches near my mouth and jaw line. After washing my face with this cleanser, my skin felt hydrated and more even-textured...So the next day, I bought this cleanser! However, it has been a week and my pores very large and I'm beginning to notice black heads :( my skin feels hydrated, but I'm still noticing a bit of dryness.",1
leaves the skin feeling fresh and revived... just loving it,1
"I am a 33 year old Latina with combination oily/normal skin. I didn't like the marketing on this as something that was to protect skin from hormonal aging (not there yet), but I loved the creamy texture and the way it left my skin feeling soft. Also, a little really goes a long way. It's worht the splurge.",1
"My best friend sent this in a care package - I recently moved from Southern CA to the east coast. My skin was feeling very dry, but I was hesitant to try a more moisturizing product because they usually lead to breakouts. Not so! My skin now feels very well-balanced and looks much more even. I use this product at night and Murad's Refreshing Cleanser in the morning.",1
very good cleaning-rich lather and does a great job.,1
Love it! Gentle and non-drying but gets your face clean and leaves it feeling soft.,1
"i like it, but not so crazy about the smell.",1
I'm a 42 year old African American female who has tried numerous cleansers. This cleanser has done wonders for my skin by noramalizing the texture as well as getting rid of the dark spots. Frequently complimented on how good and young I look! A great product.,1
it left a tight and clean feeling to the skin. very hydrating. 2 thumbs up,1
"I love this cleansing cream.my skin looks healthier,less acne.",1
"nice smell, texture, and feels good on dry skin.but it isn't easily washed out. you need to use warm water and care of it.",1
I have many cleanser (fickle) so I added this to my collection. It's highly concentrated yet still gentle. Don't let the pearl-like appearance freak you out. It feels soothing on skin plus it's nourishing. This will last a long time.,1
"A non-drying cleansing cream that does the job. After several failed attempts, this one delivers as promised. Great for winter skin.",1
This cleanses well and does not leave my skin feeling dry.,1
I love this cleansing cream. I used it a year ago and stopped because I had to be in a club to purchase it. I was so excited when I found it in the store. I can really tell a difference now that I'm using it again!,1
"Returned this product as it was to foamy to use with my Clarisonic and stings my eyes. On the plus side a very tiny amount is needed, less than the tip of a fingernail. Even using this small amount it was to foamy for me and took to long to rinse well. This is really not an exfoliating cleanser either .",0
"This is a great cleanser. It removes all my makeup and makes my skin glow and feel so soft. I tried this with the Resurgence serum and night moisturizer, and these products have just saved my skin.",1
Leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated even before putting on moisturizer.,1
I love this cleanser by Murad! It really gets your skin clean---without feeling dry aferwards. And it's very concentrated---so you need very little---like the size of your fingernail---literally!I highly recommend this product for those wanting an excellent quality cleanser--and one that is a great value for the money as well.,1
"I use several cleansers to keep my skin looking younger and moist. I find of all the Murad products I have tried, this cleanser is the one product that I will use. Very gentle.",1
Good cleaning action and not too drying. Large size for the $$.,1
I love Boscia products. This is a great mask that hydrates and leaves my skin feeling great. It's not as silky in the morning as I was anticipating but it's still fairly hydrating for my very dry skin.,1
"I have been using this product for over a year and I have to say that my skin is looking better all the time. It does hydrate and exfoliate just like it says! I also use the day and night cream. Considering the price of $35 and you get a large bottle of this stuff, it's really not that expensive.",1
"I definately have hormonal skin; I get breakouts once a month, dry patches, fine lines even thought I am still young.I LOVE this entire line! I can literally control a breakout from the begining by using the wash, toner and serum. My skin is brighter, clearer, and better moisturized since switching to this line. I started using the line to prep for my wedding and had perfect skin even through the stress... LOVE IT!",1
I was using this cleanser for about a year and thought I wanted to try something less expensive. I instantly started breaking out and went back to Murad. My skin cleared instantly. I really believe it helps any hormonal imbalance and will never stray again!!,1
"This is a wonderful cleanser! It manages to be gentle and exfoliate at the same time, and it's in cream form, so it's hydrating -- not drying at all. A little goes a long way, so the $35 is worth spending; you don't need to use a lot for it to do its job. My skin feels refreshed, clear and moisturized. Highly recommend this!",1
"i had been looking for something to exfoliate my skin which has become a bit dull since i turned 30 about 6 months ago. i had blackheads all over my chin that just wouldn't go away and made my skin feel rough. i'd use a biore strip now and again, but the skin would be rough two days later. the blackheads were so tiny it's not like i could squeeze them out either (shame, shame). i know that EfoliKate did wonders for my chin and face, but $85 is a lot of money for the smallest size they carry, so i decided to give the Murad a shot. glad i did! i noticed a difference after one use! my skin was not dried out, it felt smoother and full of moisture and radiance. it exfoliate with enzymes, not micro-abrading grains like most exfoliators. and you really only need a pearl-sized squirt. i was able to use that tiny amount to wash my face and the top of my back, which is also a problem area. considering it's $35 for a 6-point-something ounce bottle i'd say this is the best value i've found for a product that actually works...",1
"This is a great cleanser! It cleans without drying my skin. I also have sensitive skin and have had allergic reactions to many other products, but have had no problems at all with this one.",1
Love the way this makes my skin feel. It keeps it smooth and clean without any dryness. I believe it helps with fine lines when you combine it with the rest of the regime. I will keep buying the product.,1
"I love this cleanser, non-abrasive and smells great",1
"fragrance free, smooth texture, and very gentle. yet effectively cleanses make-up as well. excellent for dry skin.this is my fourth tube.",1
I love Murad products!,1
"I received a sample of this cleanser and really liked it, yet, once I purchased it and used if for a few days, I found it to be too oily. My combination skin obviously felt too greasy and simply unclean after using this product. Again, I wanted to like this cleanser but . . .",0
"I LOVe LOVE LOVE the Murad line. I have SUPER dry/sensitive skin and I've tried it ALLLLLL. Once I got my hands on the Murad Day Lotion I was sold...I figured all their other products would be just as good and I was right. The cleansing cream is amazing, the eye cream just as good and the toner is also wonderful although it can irritate ur eyes a bit...but still AMAZING!! I definitely recommend if you have DRY skin.",1
"This product is creamy, yet, light and refreshing. I really feel like I get a deep cleansing whenever I use it.",1
This product is great for face and neck. It has a light exfoliation and great cleanser. It keeps my face feeling fresh and clean all day.,1
"very good and effective, but gentle, doesn't leave your face dried out",1
"I have had a cabinet full of cosmetics looking for the best one for my face. I have always had nice skin, but then I have always taken care of it too. As I have gotten older I have been looking for cleansers and moisturizers that make my skin look like I am 30 again. I love this cleanser. It really gets my face clean, cleans my pores beautifully. I use it with my Clairisonic which just amps up the effect.",1
"Great cleanser, cleans your face without drying it out.",1
"I WAS TOLD MY SEPH. STORE WOULD NO LONGER BE CARRYING SKYNN CELAND OR THEIR GLACIAL FACE WASH WHICH WAS WHAT I WENT IN THERE FOR SO THEY TOLD ME THIS WAS SI,ILAR. SO FAR I THINK I LIKE IT BETTER.",1
Good cleanser but I do not care for the scent. I'm not overly excited about this product.,0
I love the way this cleansing cream lathers. It works very nicely with my Clarisonic cleansing brush.,1
I have very very dry skin and this cleansing cream cleans without drying me out. Just a small amount goes a long way. Love the scent as well.,1
"I have used this cleanser for quite some time now and I absolutely love this product. My face feels clean, not dry. My skin looks dewy and fresh. I know that soundscliche, but I have never used a product that actually made my face feel this clean and yet not dry and itchy.",1
"I've been using Murad's ""Vitalic Energizing Pomegranate Cleanser,"" but I'm always on the lookout for new and better products so I thought I'd give this one a try. The cleansing cream did a good job of removing every bit of dirt, oil and makeup from my skin and it did a good job of keeping my skin exfoliated and my pores unclogged. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. However, the Murad ""Pomegranate Cleanser"" is a two-in-one dual-purpose product that cleanses and tones in one step and saves me time since I don't have to use a separate toner product after cleansing. The first time I used it I wanted to test to see how clean it actually got my face so I used my regular toner on my face and the toner pad came away completely clearâ€”no dirt or makeup left behind at all. So I know that it really does cleanse and tone my very oily skin in one step as it promises. It smells great and lathers easily. The pump dispenser is very convenient, too. Even though the ""Resurgence Cleansing Cream"" is a good cleanser, I am going to stick with the pomegranate cleanser because of it being a cleanser and toner all in one.",1
I'm always looking for products that will protect my aging skin. This facewash is wonderful. Other cleansers of this type seem to leave my face oily. This cleans my face well without leaving it oily or drying it out. I love it!,1
"I have never had dry skin before, but this winter took a toll on my skin, and even with great moisturizers, my skin was flaky. I decided to give this facewash a try as I am a big fan of all Murad products I have tried in the past, and I LOVE IT. It balanced out my skin so that it is not flaky, but not overly moisturized - great for people with combination skin. Now that my skin is balanced out better, my acne has gotten better as well. This product is great and I will never go back to what I used before.",1
great all purpose cleaner,1
This is a great everyday cleanser. It is gentle and non-drying and works well.,1
"I like this product because I have aging sensitive skin, and my skin feels clean and not stripped after use. The missing star is because I need to wash my face twice sometimes after using an SPF moisturizer.",1
"I normally get hormonal breakouts and I have reactions to any acne medication in face wash so I just use a gentle cleanser and my trusty clarisonic as well an occasional sulfur mask and spot treatment. Lately my skin has been outrageously dry and breaking out everywhere! Probably due to these annoying snow storms in the Mid-Atlantic :). I'm a Sephora employee and while at work I was looking through all the cleansers to find one with no acne medication and moisture boosting effects. I found this, took a sample, ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. With in 2 days my skin's dryness was disappearing and my acne was cleared up (even more so than with my normal cleanser -Skyn Iceland-). Definitely recommend to anyone looking to restore moisture and clean deep down. I even noticed that at night after I washed out my clarisonic the brush seemed whiter than before :).",1
I've always used Philosophy products for my face but decided to try something new. I LOVE it. It's gentle and effective. I noticed improvements in my skin within about 2 days. I did purchase the toner and night cream with it.,1
"Love this stuff. A tiny bit goes a long way, and it removes makeup and leaves my face feeling soooo clean, without drying it out. A+++",1
"The best Murad product I've tried. I have oily skin, and it's just right for me. Not too dying, and not too oily. It helped me clear out my pimples as well. It goes a long way too. Just a pear-sized amount is enough for my whole face and neck.",1
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the whole line of Murad Resurgence skin care. At 53, I need all the help I can get and it totally delivers!!",1
"this product delivers. it's gently on, yet leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. it's a keeper",1
I have been using this product for several years and it has helped to keep my skin looking great. I use it in the morning and at night. Wonderful product as it helps to moisturize and cleanse my skin and also removes makeup.,1
I love this facewash it's great for cleansing while keeping skin looking youthful and vibrant,1
"Wonderful cleanser for aging skin. Love he pearlized consistency. Just bought my 2nd bottle, only need a small amount, a little goes a long way.",1
"Someone at Sephora pointed me towards this cleanser. I wasn't wild about the price at first. About a week after I started using it, I realized that my skin looked younger and more fresh. It takes all my make-up off easily, and is a great pick-me-up in the morning. Couldn't be happier!",1
"This is a wonderful product for dry or mature skin. It left my skin feeling so clean, but without the tight and dry feeling a lot of cleansers do. Thank you, Murad for great cleanser.",1
"I went in to Sephora a few weeks ago to look for something to save me from a sudden face outbreak, and the very helpful consultant helped me pick this one out. I have really dry skin, and was apparently over-washing it with very harsh facewash in a effort to kill the outbreak, which was apparently only making the situation worse. Since I've been using this product for the last few weeks, things have gotten a lot better and my face is almost back to normal. It's really nice and gentle and effective. It's only been a few weeks, so I can't vouch for long term effects, but it helped me tremendously.",1
"I have experimented with many high-end anti-aging cleansing regimes. This by far works the best for me. I use the Renewing Cleansing Cream with the Resurgence Sheer Lustre Day Lotion SPF 15, and the Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream. I am relieved of flaky skin without added oilyness. Murad Resurgence products have a nice clean scent without being too perfumey.",1
"Well I use the Cleansing cream, the Age diffusing serum, and then the hydrating cream. I have never had such clear, acne free, smooth, soft skin in my life. I'm 26 years old and I thought I was still experiencing acne!! I had dry patches sometimes, but then oily in the T Zone area. So I thought I had combination skin. Well I started using this regiment and my skin is absolutely perfect. My skin is hydrated all day, and its so smooth! My skin looks even better now, when I put on make up, although most of the time unless it s special occasion, I will go without foundation! I will never use anything else!",1
Murad's Resurgence Renewing Cleansing Cream is a great product. It is very soothing and my face always feels so refresh after I wash. Even before I apply the night cream. I would highly recommend this product.,1
"this product is ok. I am pregnant, and thought it would be great with my hormones going kooky. However it tends to dry my skin out. I am used to using the Essential C cleanser, and I actually prefer it to this one. also has a funny smell to it, almosts chokes ya!!",1
This product feels so gentle and soft on your skin and the best part is that you only need a little bit to cleanse your face and neck - should last for months and months. I will not be switching cleansers.,1
"very cleaning and so moisturizing. keeps my skinin a nice balanced place, while never ever drying. skin turns smooth as silk.",1
I HAVE USED THIS CLEANSER FOR SOME TIME NOW AND IT IS SUCH AN AWSOME PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT DRY MY FACE OUT NOR DOES IT LEAVE IT GREASY. I AM PUSHING 50 AND USED TO HAVE OCCASSIONAL BREAKOUTS BUT SINCE I STARTED USING THIS I HAVE HAD NO MORE PROBLEMS. THANK YOU MURAD.,1
Have used this cleanser for over a year - have gave samples to all my over-40 friends who are now devoted users also - simply the best,1
Wasn't too sure what I would think of this product but I really do like it. I am now using this instead of Purity Made Simple.,1
Leaves my skin soft and refreshed,1
"This face wash is great for its purpose- renewing.. however, if you are trying to wash your face of makeup etc, then this is not for you. This can be used to wash your face in the morning since your face is more or less already clean, and it allows the skin to feel smooth and helps with wrinkles if used often..",1
"A sephora rep recommended this cleanser because I was breaking out and also had dry skin. while it had a good lather, I would have to wash my face twice as it just did not feel or look clean. Maybe more suited for someone older.",1
One of my favorite Murad products. Leaves my skin glowing!,1
"This is a very thorough, gentle cleanser.",1
"this wash is great if you have combination/dry skin. it balances out the dry spots, and keeps the moisture barrier to your skin intact so that the oily spots don't create more oil. it also exfoliates without granular pieces, just alpha hydroxy, so it's very very gentle.",1
This is a great product for mature skin. Cleans without drying and leaves it feeling smooth and soft. Love it!,1
"And, finally, this product, too, turned out to cause extreme redness and blotchiness. Wish I could return it as well!",0
"I have combo skin: sensitive, very dry spots, tendency towards oiliness in the T-zone, and frequent mild breakouts. I don't think I could live without this cleanser...It leaves my skin CLEAN, but not one bit stripped. It removes all traces of makeup, even waterproof eyeliner and mascara with a little massaging. It's really so gentle but so thorough at the same time. I also love the ingredient list: the abundance of beneficial oils actually helps to control skin's oil production, and it has no parabens. I have used this for about 2.5 years and I have stopped at a couple of points but I always come back because there is just nothing better! I always wonder what made me stray, but it won't happen again. Also love the light smell...fresh and natural. Price isn't too bad either as it lasts quite a while.",1
have used Murad for a few weeks. I have noticed some difference in my skin.,1
"great texture,not drying and prevents 'aging' breakouts. Love this product will definatly buy again",1
"This cleanser dried my skin out and caused me to break out. (Also, it did not effectively take off all of my mascara-- non-waterproof.)",0
You use so little and the results are huge. You feel clean and no dryness at all. Your face radiates and feels years younger. I never travel without this product. I also have the other products that compliment the face wash.,1
"Love this product! Expensive, but one bottle lasts a whole year. Says its for ""mature"" skin, but im 25 and im obsessed with it.",1
"This is the best cleanser I've ever used. Gets my skin really clean, removes all makeup, but never makes me feel dry.",1
I have been experiencing more breakouts than normal. Tried the resurgence cleaning cream and in 3 days my skin had begun to clear up and felt great! Love the entire line of resurgence products! I'm 34 and will be using resurgence for life!,1
"This wash has worked wonders on my skin. I would break out and then whatever I used to try and clear it up would be too harsh and I would have dry patches. I use this at night after I take off my make up. I have had no break outs since I have used it regularly and my skin looks even, not dried out. This may not work for everyone, but it did for me.",1
Nondrying. Foamy and light.,1
"I really love this cleanser. It doesn't really exfoliate as much as you may think, but still leaves your skin very clean and fresh. It removes all traces of makeup with just a little pea sized squirt, foams up a bit but not too much. It also smells great. The scent is fresh with citrus, not heavy or fake smelling like many cleansers. I am picky about fragrance and this product has a great clean scent. I love it and will keep using it!",1
Expected much more from this product. My face looks dull and is always red after using this product.,0
"I purchased the Murad Resurgence Renewing Cleanising Cream, and I guess it's for a drier skin than mine. It doesn't rinse off completely with water, my face doesn't feel clean after I've washed it, and my skin develops a shine sooner than with other cleansing products I've used. It would be nice for someone to come out with a renewing cleansing product for someone with combination skin. My drier areas need to be clean, too without feeling greasy.",0
"I really wanted this product to work. Especially because I hormonally breakout. I never got to see the product in action around my period because I had so many more backheads and pimple popping up around my chin that... well.. i was sad. no go for me, but may be better for others.",0
I love this facewash! After spending 15 months in Iraq my skin needed some help. I am over 40 and have tried alot of different face cleansers but this is the best I have ever used. I recommend this for anyone who want to keep youthful skin or improve their already aging skin,1
This is one of the best cleansers I've used. It cleans without drying and you get a lot of product for your $$.,1
"Now this product I absolutely love. You only use a tiny bit and it covers your entire face and neck. I actually use it to take off my eye make-up and it doesn't sting at all. It's creamy and does make a difference in my skin. Tube will last a very long time. Little pricey, but well worth it. Will definitely purchase this product again. My skin feels great after I use this.",1
"I have used every brand (cheap to EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE) out there & this line by Murad is the only product line that has worked for me & continued to work. Usually I find something & it will work for a few months then it's break out city, usually worse than I started off. But this product has been working for me for a long time now & I love it. I recommend picking up the whole line but if you cant afford it to start than get the cleansing cream, the age diffusing serum and the night cream (i use it during the day too because i am so dry). ***And just another tip: If you haven't tried a tool similar to the clarisonic scrubbing brush, get one they are a god send.",1
"gentle,washes off easily,no stinging",1
I love this cleanser. It is very thick and creamy and doesn't take much. I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my breakouts. This is the only change I made in my skincare regimen so I can honestly say it does what is says it does.,1
"I normally do not think of cleansers are being special. Most i have tried leave me skin tight and dry, or are basically unremarkable.This product is different. I noticed my skin being smoother and makeup application nicer after using this cleanser the first time! My skin felt supple and looked more smooth. I am using the serum and sheer luster day cream also in this line.Highly recommend for over 40 dry,mature skin.",1
This is truely wat my skin needed. I noticed changes in my skin in a weeks time. I love the texture and smell.,1
"I am not sure what is in this stuff but it is wonderful! Not only does it smell good, it gently cleanses leaving your face feeling great. The whole line of Resurgence is highly recommended for women over 40! My husband noticed how great my skin looked too!",1
"If your problem is hormone fluxuations, this is the cleanser for you! One of the sales consultants at Sephora recommended it a year ago for my hormone sensitive skin, and I have been grateful every day since. No more giant mountain sized period zits! Yay!",1
OK - I am a self-admitted skin care fanatic - will try them all - not matter the cost...This is the best I have ever used. It makes my skin (which is decidedly over 40) feel like silk! Not a huge fan of the rest of the resurgence line but I wold walk over hot coals for this one!,1
I have been using this product religiously and my skin looks amazing.,1
I have used this product for nearly five years and have found it to be a resurgence to my tired skin. It provides good cleansing (sudsy) smells good and leaves me feeling fresh. It is a nice generous portion and lasts a long time!,1
"This cleansing cream seemed to be ok. I didn't notice a large difference in comparison to some of the other products I've used, but it does seem to soften the skin and leave it clean feeling and doesn't dry the skin. When used with the other Murad products, however, I noticed that all the products together left my face feeling oily and heavy.",1
"I'm 47,..I have tried many cleansers, toners, creams, etc. since the age of 20. for the past 12 years I was using Mario Badescu, and Kinerase cream,.which I love! about 1 week ago I got a try me pack of the Murad Resurgence line. I don't know what is in this stuff,...especially this amazing cleanser,..but it makes my normally nice skin look really FANTASTIC! even calming down my slight rosacea. If you are in your mid 30's & above,.you gotta try this! Your skin will glow!",1
"I've used everything over the years but nothing is as good as this cleansing cream. From the very first time I used it, it has replaced every soap, lotion or cream cleaner in my bathroom along with all their promised but undelivered results. This cleanser is truly a renewing treatment each and every time you wash with it...my 48 year old, sun damaged skin, has NEVER looked this good or healthy and everyone has noticed....makeup goes on more evenly, lines are less obvious and the sun damage shows constant improvement. I've used this product for 3 months now and will never switch again!",1
This is the most wonderful cleanser. It really does what it says it will do.. And a very tiny amount goes a long way... Very worth it,1
This is just a good everyday non drying cleanser. It feels good going on the skin and leaves it soft and clean.,1
I love it. It leaves my skin refrershed and clean. It doesn't dry it out or leave it oily. I would recommend.,1
"I have incredibly sensitive skin. Whenever my skin is freaking out I slap this on for 20 minutes and its instant relief. I don't know what I would do without this stuff. It calms, cools, soothes, and hydrates my skin immediately!",1
"I've got very pale, very sensitive, very dry, prone-to-redness sorta skin and this stuff, while not the most obviously moisturizing, is amazing for keeping moisture in while creating a less oily surface for makeup. I don't generally use it as they say to, I tend to wash my face then apply it, then apply a light sunscreen and makeup as needed and it totally de-reds (that's a word, right?) my face. I've noticed over time using it that my skin is also a fair bit more 'fair' than 'red' too. Definite staple to my daily routine now!",1
I received a sample in my play box and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I've only used it a few times but it has already helped with my dry skin!,1
"I have dry to normal skin, and I do think it both hydrates and detoxes my face.",1
"I like to use this product after a long day of makeup. It temporarily tightens my pores, which is the issue. I shouldn't have to use a mask more than once a week. I normally perform glycolic or double layered glycolic mandelic peels on myself which keeps my pores small for 1-2 weeks. Biggest pro: my mild rosacea is calmed by the next morning. Biggest con: having to use it so often.",1
This product wasn't for me. I don't want skincare samples in my play box i want makeup samples duuh,0
"I love it,its excellent product.",1
i finally perfected my skincare routine until this broke me out completely. i don't have sensitive skin! i did a clay mask (that i've done many times before) and then i used this and now my face has so many break outs. i guess this is what i get for trying out new things lol. (it was a sample in sephora play),0
"I expected cooling and hydration with this mask, but was surprised by how well it exfoliated. It's almost like a peel. ",1
"Received this deluxe sample in the July 2017 play box. Put it in the fridge as suggested for maximum cooling an puffiness reducing benefits. My skin is extremely dry so I use it as a last step before bed. My skin is very soft and undereye area is less puffy in the morning, however I do not think I will be purchasing the full size as it is very expensive for basically a very basic moisturizing mask! Nice effects but not worth the full size price.",1
Nothing special. Skin feels soft but the product is very sticky,1
"I store mine in the fridge and use it 2-3 times a week . WOW it is Cooling , hydrating and leaves your skin super soft ! A must have , especially in the summer so refreshing to your skin . ",1
"i have very textured skin (from acne scars and things like that), and this mask worked wonders. i received it in my play! box, and when i tried it, my skin was so smooth and soft. probably the softest it's been in 5 years. i paired it with the Ren Evercalm day protection cream, and it's a miracle!",1
"I have no idea why one would purchase this for $52. I happened to get one as a sample, and it's just basic aloe. It doesn't even qualify as a ""mask"" that you'd leave on for 10 minutes, as instructed. Aloe does lovely things to the skin, but you can just as easily read the ingredients and pick up a tub of the same stuff at the grocery store.",0
I had been breaking out a lot around my chin and cheeks lately. I got this from the points I had so decided to try it and it really got rib of most of my acne I had with in 3 uses and also used there face cream worked very well thanks,1
I have always wanted to try this. When I saw it in the rewards and didn't get it because I wanted another reward I knew I had to buy it. I have used it as a mask and I've also used it overnight. I am pleased with the results. It left my skin nice and soft. A little goes a long way. I definitely recommend this to everyone.,1
I absolutely love this mask for when I've gotten a little too much sun or had a few too many drinks the night before and feel like my skin needs some serious detoxing and moisture replenishment. Gives me back my glow.,1
"This product is wonderful the day after a peel, or retinol treatment. It's extremely relaxing, hydrating and best of all soothing. I also love to use it after a hot day. My skin looks and feels hydrated, subtle and rejuvenated.",1
"I bought this as 100 point perk but wasn't super excited about it. I saw it and put it on and it felt fine on my face, leaving my skin very soft. I woke up the next morning and my face was still so soft and smooth- Still from the mask. Now I am excited about it and the results I will get for using it more consistently.",1
"This is a very soothing and detoxifying mask.It's an interesting formula, but I like it a lot. You can really feel it clean out your pores.",1
I had a sample of this and recently got a decent sunburn on my face so I thought I would give it a shot. It's pretty much a way more expensive version of aloe that doesn't work as good. I wouldn't buy this.,0
It has been a pleasant surprise got a sample (100pt reward) and it does hydrate although you have to rinse your skin will look great!,1
"I received this as a 100 point perk a while back and honestly I love this stuff. A little goes a long way so my sample is still going strong. I have dry, very sensitive skin. I use this whenever I have rosacea, dry patches, sunburn, dullness, or just general irritations. Most recently I tried out a new eye cream, face lotion, and cleanser and had a bad reaction to them. Tonight I put this stuff all over my face and will keep it on overnight. It feels like aloe vera gel when applying but when dry it is so lightweight and calming. It is not as hydrating as some other masks but that's not what I'm looking for out of this. I cannot say enough good things about this face mask. Will be purchasing the tub when I run out of my sample.",1
"I got this as a sample for 100 points and I loooooove it. Probably one of the best samples I've ever received. It is so cooling (great for this hot summer weather) and smoothing without being sticky or leaving behind residue. Love it so much, I just ordered more.",1
"I have combination skin and nothing controls my breakouts/oily areas. Everything I've tried for preventing breakouts is either too drying and strips my skin of any moisture, or it makes my skin moisturized but ends up breaking me out. This stuff is magic for my skin! When I get any patches of acne I just put this on overnight and within a week the acne and redness is GONE. I love this stuff. It's my newest staple for my skincare for sure.. Plus it looks like lime jello and smells amazing!",1
I tend to have red cheeks no matter how much moisturizer or serum I use that are supposed to clear them up.,1
"I visited my local sephora a few months ago looking for some skin care suggestions. I have had acne since I was a teenager, nothing too terrible but consistent and I was never comfortable without a full cover, full face of makeup. I'm now 25 and really wanted to focus on healing my skin and taking care of the problems rather than covering them. One of the employees suggested for me to replace my mosturizers with this product and use it in small amounts and rub it in, don't wash it off. A week later I noticed my blemishes were smaller and nothing new was forming. Here I am maybe 2 months later with blemish free skin! I've tried many different cleansers and treatments before and I've never had skin like this! I'm honestly still blown away!!!",1
Peter Thomas Roth masks are now the only ones I will use. This one in particular is my all time favorite. It's very cooling and moisturizing. I have dry skin and use this a few times a week to bring some hydration back into my skin. Definitely worth the price and will definitely be repurchasing!,1
"First of all I would like to mention to all that follows me as well as those of you that have recently found my reviews. Thank you all for following me as I do buy many products from Sephora from makeup to face regimes. I have never been a big fan of PTR however. This Cucumber Gel Mask Extreme Detoxifying Hydrator is the next best thing other than Heaven. I normally never try 1000s of samples I get through my orders, I did original get the Peter Thomas Roth ULTIMATE ANTI-AGING MUST HAVES with 500 points as I have tried the whole set. I absolutely fell in love with the Cucumber Gel Mask so in my last order I ordered the full size jar and I own and use many face serums, eye serums and moisturizers that I buy from Sephora and Dillard's which I have wasted a lot of money on products that ""claim"" there is so many out here is just that! Now to this product, if you are one with combination to dry skin buy this I promise you'll not need another moisturizer or face mask! (for over night) please read about use with makeup below).This product does state to apply to a clean face, allow to sit for 10 minutes then wash off it also claims to leave on your face over night for a Extreme Detoxifying Hydrator as I use this 2-3 times per night in a week if my face is extremely dry, redness it is mild enough to use every day and I have. My skin has never felt so refreshed, hydrated and baby soft in 20 years. I am now 50 and it is harder to find something that works as it claims for more mature skin, this product is the best for the purposes I have honestly listed below.This product does wonders for any skin type, dry, dry patches, redness,and combination skin types. i don't have oily skin therefore I can't make any promises there but i am sure of how this product applies a bit sticky while applying it but it dries into a soft non stick smooth thin layer on your face with a cooling effect you can actually feel working into the skin. (I do refrigerate mine) this is not a must however, I do find it to feel very cool and helps to open my pores when I do apply it. As I sleep it is dry and smooth until the next morning and it don't transfer off onto your clothing or pillows.I do recommend in using a good face primer before using makeup (foundations, concealers and powders) as this product will dry as a thin mask. It is suitable for any ages including acne prone skin. I have used the Estee Lauder Night repair complex II for three years now as I swear by it too. I use the EL when my oily part of my face around my T bone, outside of my nostrils, over my brows when I see red bumps or acne from oils that only appear in those areas at times. I have now found by using the PTR over that product or my face serums it works much better and seals in any night serum I may have on. I also have found by using this product alone without any serums it works just as well and leaves my face almost flawless the next morning.There is nothing I can say is bad about this product and I am glad I did give PTR a chance as I stated I have never been a big fan of PTR products until this came in and I will always keep a jar on hand no matter the season, it is that wonderful! Wake up with a hydrated face with a soft clean texture. If you have severe problems such as breakouts, severe acne or severe irritated skin I would be safe to say give this product 2-4 nights. If you just need a hydrated look from dry or patchy skin give it a night. You can honestly feel it working within 10 minutes after the product has fully dried. Thumbs up PTR for finally making a product stands to more than it claims!Look no further!",1
"I suffer from moderate rosacea and I am always trying different skin care products to soothe my face. My T-zone is oily and my cheeks are dry. When my rosacea flares up they get red with acne like bumps (but it's not acne) and my face has a hot, burning, feverish feeling which is miserable. I applied this mask in a thin layer all over my face including my T zone and left it on over night. It did not feel uncomfortable leaving it on and it was completely absorbed by morning. The best part is, while my cheeks are still pink today, they are not as red, the bumps are disappearing, and the best part is that the hot and burning sensation is completely gone! My face felt so hot for 2 days straight then after using this mask one time over night it significantly improved my rosacea flare up...this will be my new go to overnight mask!!! It's lightweight but hydrating, non oily, and no strong fragrance. I highly recommend this to anyone! I am sure it would be a dream for a sunburn as well!",1
I have sensitive skin and I love this mask. Sometimes my skin gets irritated or red and this mask really soothes it. It's super lightweight and different from any other mask I've used.,1
This mask is really nice on the skin. It feels very cooling and is really hydrating. My cheeks are the dry parts of my face and I use this only on my cheeks. This mask helped with my dry skin. This is a really refreshing face mask.,1
"Omg I swear this is like an orgasm on your face!! The best, the most refreshing, the most moisturizing, the most repairing and best overall mask I have tried (and I have tried many). My skin is extremely sensitive with red spots, very dry in some places (due to acne medication), very oily in others and probe to breakouts. This mask did NOT irritate my skin, it cleared up the redness, I did NOT break out (it actually cleared my acne) and was left with amazingly smooth and hydrated skin. My trick, put it in the fridge in the morning, and then at night leave it on for an hour. You will feel like you are at a spa. Seriously, do not walk, run to get this product ASAP! I promise that you will not be disappointed! If I was famous I would absolutely be a spokesperson for PTR. His products are amazing and they always deliver!!!!",1
"I love this stuff. I use the peeling gel first, then this, then the anti aging gel and I feel like I am 14. Lol.",1
I've always been scared to try new products because I have extremely sensitive skin and almost everything irritates it. This mask did my skin wonders to the point where I used every last bit of product. Worth every penny!!!!!,1
"Before I started using this, every time I had my face waxed, I would break out and there would be tiny red bumps all along my cheeks and forehead- but this mask had changed EVERYTHING! I use it right after my waxing and then two days afterwards as well. Since doing this, I've stopped breaking out after my waxing. Loves it.",1
"I bought this full size mask in a kit for $25/ 5 products! I didn't realize the mask alone was worth this much. It's really calming and soothing. I use it with the wash and moisturizer. Talk about the ultimate deal. They're all great products. I was skeptical with the price point, and it being a close out kit, but they are great. I was worried they were all discontinued, but glad to see the mask is still here.",1
I love my sample of this mask! Not sure if I would buy a full container... maybe the large variety pack and give them out as Christmas gifts ?,1
"I saw this mask in Sephora one day while searching for a mask that would hydrate my extremely dry, flaky skin. I took home a sample of it, used it once, and I was sold. ",1
"After sampling a perfume that I negatively reacted to, I put this mask on my neck and it worked amazingly! I rinsed it off and the next morning my dry red patches were gone!",1
I use this mask 2x a week and notice a huge difference as my skin is no longer dry . I put it in the fridge. It feels great !,1
"I tend to have redness, but this Cucumber mask is a life saver!!! I use it 2 to 3 times a week. I tend to sleep with it on as a treatment. It hydrates my oily skin and calms my redness. I definitely recommend this to everyone!",1
"I use this every single morning to start off my day. I keep it in the fridge so it's nice and cool when I apply it first thing in the morning. Really good pick me up, and great for making my eyes feel less puffy if I didn't sleep well. My skin type: I started on tretinoin a few months ago, and I am still in the dry skin stage (my skin used to be oily prior to being on tretinoin). This helps put the moisture back in my skin and doesn't cause irritation (as the tretinoin has caused my skin to be sensitive as well).",1
So good soothes my skin when there's redness or dry patches !!,1
"I am a 50yo man and have always hated moisturizing masks. I have never had acne in in my life. Even as a teen I would shave my face with baby oil instead of shaving cream and I still never got a single pimple. But I don't know what they put in them- but if I ever try anything that's labled ""moisturizing mask"" I immediately break out with horrible acne- so I never use them. Until now. I kinda went overboard this week and used too many peel pads and scrubs and my face was so dry and itchy. I looked in my box and saw this PTR Cucumber Mask that I got as a sample and never tried. So- I tried it. 3 times now. No acne! Yeah!!!!!! Perfect amount of moisture for what I needed too. The sample is good enough for several applications but I will totally be buying the full size now when I am done.",1
I really like this mask especially when I look tired and I put it on maybe for 8-10 mins I wash it off the next day my skin is hydrated and clear complexion even skin tone redness is gone. It has a clear glow . I love it !,1
leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated.,1
My sister showed me this need trick.....we use it for the neck and it works wonders! Gone is the gobble look.,1
"I got this in the sample pack and have been using it frequently, I layer on a pretty thick amount and by the time 10 minutes has rolled by very much of the product has absorbed into my skin, leaving it plumped and soft, and I have even used it after battling a sinus infection ( think, red, chafed nostrils!) and it does not irritate the skin. i have sensitive sort of dry skin, and some hormonal acne along my jaw line. Ill repurchase this for sure.",1
"If you're moderately dry or just need an occasional boost of moisture, this might be great for adding a bit of help without overdoing it. But I have very dry skin, so it didn't do much on me. The first time I used it I actually had to moisturize after, because my skin was flaking a bit, but it may have been irritated because I was trying lots of new face makeup. Now that it's calmed down, this didn't dry me out, but didn't leave me feeling extremely soft and hydrated. But it is very soothing, and I'll keep it around for after pore strips and things. I like the texture.",1
"This product is not transforming, however, it is a nice mask. I typically have oily skin but having a cold and going swimming for 3 weeks straight dried my skin out. This mask helped to calm my skin and take away redness from any irritation. It felt very soothing and I think it helped open up my sinuses which helped a lot. I'm not sure if it's worth the price but if you have the opportunity to get a sample than go for it.",1
My skin is normally very oily but I use the mask when I'm peeling or very dry which is occasionally. However when I use the mask I don't notice any difference & my skin feels the same. I feel like I'm putting aloe Vera on my face.,0
I do not have sensitive skin at all. I do not ever get pimples (unless is that time of the month) but this mask every single time I would use it I would get a pimple every time! I returned it after using it for 2 weeks.,0
This mask is very average and doesn't seem to do much unless used after waxing or epilating. It calms the skin and helps with some of the redness.,1
When I first tried it it did nothing. I left it on for the recommended time on the back of the container. I was very disappointed. I decided to leave it on for an hour the Second time I used it. And it did wonders. My skin was smooth but felt detoxified and clean. My skin was very moisturized and felt amazing. I got a sample. It is quite expensive.,1
"I love this mask! I use it twice a week, and it really calms and hydrates my skin. It leaves a smooth and fresh feeling. I definitely recommend it!",1
"It's very great, I use it everyday at the end of the day as a thin mask for my awful redness. Since I have been using it, about a month, I have noticed everyday when I wake up my redness is reduced by a lot. It's really great, it has a bit of a sticky, tacky feeling that lingers for a bit as it dries, but it's still an awesome product! ",1
Lots of love for this mask. It cleared out my acnes and I've been using it ever since. I try to use it daily. Works best for calming detoxifying the skin.,1
"I live in a very hot area in the inland empire of SoCal, so it's very dry here all the time. Especially now since there is very little rain in California. I got this little trial sample with my rewards points back in January, and I was pretty excited because I'm all about moisturizing my face. I used to have heavy acne that has since diminished in college, but really most of it is gone because of healthier-eating, my clarisonic brush (which I don't have anymore), and lots of moisturizing!! I've tried Clinique moisture surge, and am currently on ""belif true cream moisturizing bomb,"" both of which I totally love. I also buy a lot of Asian/Korean face masks to treat my skin every now and then. So I'm always looking for the next best moisturizer, and gel to boot. As a trial, I've used it here and there over the summer hoping that my skin would liven up and become soft and supple again. I don't reccommend this product if you have super dry skin because it's really not working for me. My skin had been SO dry that it felt flaky and not soft and smooth, putting this on was just really 'meh.' It barely dented the ""armor"" so to speak. My skin type is I guess ""thick"" and that's why it's good to exfoliate all the time, which I do, but only helps the surface of my skin. I had a munch better time using something else like natural coconut oil and fresh-cut aloe vera from my garden, and my own fresh-cut cucumbers to help with the dryness. Probably going to stick to what I have.",1
"I received this mask as a trial. Need to said: I'm not a freak of the skin care because at this time I never suffering of any imperfection... But, few weeks later; I saw my skin so dull, eye-bags & my first fine lines (all at the same time!). I browse on my make-up room for the samples box & I use several (for one or two days as more=you can't see any improve) but this ""little"" sample (6 months of use) & need to said I can't see results on the first day but with continues use I need to said: This mask is ""underrated"" because is more than good. I see my skin soft without redness, non-puffy (all face) & fine lines less noticeable. Non-greasy at all (I have super oily skin) & works! I buy the big version because you need to be constant & in comparison to another's ""overrated"" products that make skin break-out or with patches; this is gentle but more than good. I'm think on an abrasive derma-technique & after use this mask I desist of do something so harsh to my face because look great. Age Range: Middle 30's Extra White Complexion Oily Lot of Make-Up User At Young Age=Surfer without Skin Protection.",1
This is hands down the most refreshing mask if you are sun burned. I am obsessed cooling feel this mask gives; without feeling super oily. Win.,1
This mask is nice and cooling. Not sure it did anything though.,1
I have dry red skin and small breakouts and this mask totally helped! My face wasn't red it calmed my skin and hydrated it. Love this and will buy again.,1
"I absolutely love this product. It can be used as thin layer, over night or thicker layer and wash off in more than 20 minutes. Very gentle and does not cause allergy reactions, even thought it is not all natural. The down side is that it is expensive, I wish they had a medium size of the mask with less pricepoint. I had been trying to get the full size but can't afford it. I always go for the smaller sizes offered which is not enough :(",1
I love this product. I got a bad sunburn on my face and I asked th employee for the best thing for it and he suggested this. I put a thick mask of this on in the evening and a light layer of the other cucumber cream in the morning. This is wonderful. I use it everyday now.,1
A must have for moisturizing my skin in the summertime,1
"It's a nice cooking mask, however it is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.",1
This really works if you use it once every day. It is getting rid of my acne.,1
I usually use this in the morning and before I go to bed. This is totally perfect to use for a moisturizer before putting on makeup. It's so worth its price. It really soothes out your skin and makes it feel brighter.,1
"It has a nice cooling effect on the skin, but I didn't notice any real difference after washing it off. No reduction in redness, no softer skin. I think for the price, there are better masks out there. I can see this being good after a sunburn or wax, but that's about it.",0
I use about 5 bottles of this one every year along with my nuface. Fantastic!,1
I have been using this almost every day! the cucumber mask leaves my skin feeling very soft and it is even more softer when I chill the mask in the refrigerator !,1
I use this mask after I get extractions and it works so well at calming the red and inflamed skin. Just the cooling property's would be enough for me to buy it but the fact that it makes the redness go away much faster and helps a huge amount with the swelling. You can apply a thick layer let it sit for awhile then rinse or use it like a moisturizer before bed and sleep in it. Though the price tag may seem high this is PTR's most included mask it's in tons of kits and if your a VIB or VIB rouge I have gotten a bunch of these from promo codes.,1
"I wouldn't call myself a mask-aholic, but I do love to usethem. Not to mention the quality of PTR products.The Cucumber gel mask is the best moisture mask I'veused! Easy to apply, easy to remove and offers moisturization without the heavy emollients of othermoisture masks.",1
"I have combo skin with acne, and my skin is also super sensitive. I was using some products recommended by my doctor to help control my acne but my skin sensitivity started and had redness all over. I had been using a new moisturizer that wasn't adding enough power to counter act the dryness provided by the regimen. I have had the mask laying around, and used it on occasions but decided to add it to my nightly routine hoping it would help control my redness and irritation. This new step has completely changed my life, after three days the redness and imitation were gone. I put a layer at night and sleep on the mask. in the morning my skin feels hydrated and calm, no extra oiliness has occurred and know I simply have my normal acne.",1
It's not that this mask is bad. It felt nice going on but I feel like I might as well use aloe. It's just over priced. My skin does feel nice after but I can get the same results with something cheaper.,0
"I got a deluxe sample in a holiday sample bag, and I'm in love. I don't rinse it off, since my skin soaks it up quite well, and leave it on overnight. I wake up with bouncy, radiant, smooth skin. It seems to soothe any red/irritated areas and smooth my skin well. During winter I have to apply a thicker moisturizer on top, but during the warmer seasons this is a nice night treatment once a week or so. I have yet to totally finish the sample, but I'll be repurchasing once I do. It's a winner for combination that leans a bit dry, sensitive, sometimes acne prone skin.",1
"I bought the sample 3 pack with this mask, the Irish moor, and the gold mask. I tried this one first and left in on overnight. My skin has never looked so RADIANT! My skin is also very very smooth after washing it off. I tend to have dry skin so this product help with hydration",1
"I have dry skin and I got a sample from this product, I tried it, but it did nothing. I reallz wanted to love coz I heard a lot of good things about it, but unfortunately for me it wasnt.",0
"I got a sample of this as a birthday points gift and didn't realize how much I would enjoy it. I use this daily--it never dries out my sensitive skin, and I often get patchy dry areas when the weather changes (which it does frequently in the Carolinas). It is best on dry skin but you can leave it on for a few minutes or ten, depending on how much you want to unclog everything. My skin is noticeably smoother--pores are reduced, too! You only need about the size of a pea--a thin layer does the trick. Great product--some of the other masks are too harsh for me (pumpkin, for instance). This is a keeper.",1
"My skin is not sensitive what so ever, I try alot of products without ever having skin irritation. This is the only product I have tried in the last five years that has broken me out! Within 30 minutes of washing this product off I got whiteheads all over my face. I gave it another try months later and the exact same thing happened so I knew I had to discard of it.",0
My skin looks amazing!!!!,1
"I feel like this is only in the line up because it's known to be a good seller and item people want, but it's not that effective. It is way too mild and smells funny. If you want a hydrating, calming mask from PTR, get the rose one instead.",1
"I really like this mask, but I felt like the rose stem mask was more hydrating than this. It did ok I've used better hydrating masks but it definitely helps calm your face right after using a stronger mask like the moor mud or the pumpkin one. I use the rose stem mask to sleep in and so far I love it.",1
I only use this when I get a sunburn. I keep it in the refrigerator for the extra coolness. It soothes and hydrates my burned skin.,1
"This mask wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't great either. I was looking for a mask that would help hydrate and get rid of some of the redness/blotchiness on my face. The pros: it is hydrating and it didn't break me out. Cons: it didn't really do anything to even my skin tone or get rid of redness. While you get a lot of product, I couldn't justify keeping this at the price point. I found that it didn't give me any better results than a regular old moisturizer.",0
"Peter Thomas Roth has amazing products and I got the sample for the Cucumber Mask one day from my points. I use prescription acne topicals which dry out my skin like crazy. So, when I tried this, I was amazed at how much this product not only soothed my skin, but it also moisturized very well. I bought the full size product and use it almost daily - sometime a thin layer overnight and sometimes a thick layer for 10 minutes before putting my makeup on. It really does make your skin glow. Also, for the people who think this product burns your skin, it's probably because your skin is so parched that when you get moisture on it, it'll feel like burning. Aloe and cucumber are supposed to help cool your skin, not make it worse - pro tip.",1
I use it like a primer. Use my serums then put this on. Keeps my sensitive skin happy.,1
"I have extremely acne prone, oily to combo skin. I started using this as a face mask to hydrate (which it does well) but then one day I was out of my regular night time moisturizer so I applied a thin layer of this as my night time moisturizer. I woke up the next morning and all the redness from my pimples were gone and they had dramatically reduced in size. I recommend this especially for treating acne. It works better than my prescribed acne treatments!!!",1
"The first time I tried this I thought it was just ok. My skin was soft afterwards, it was nice. But so are my other masks.",1
"This gel mask is honestly wonderful, I received the sample as a Sephora birthday gift. I'm only making a review cause I saw bad reviews and wanted to do this product some justice. This product works best if you know the basics of skin; exfoliate your face first thoroughly, use the orange cleanser from PTR, tone your face, then apply this gel mask. The best results are sleeping with this on or keeping it on all day. If you're washing this off its a waste. I wake up with a firm face and glowing skin. After sleeping with this I won't even need to moisturize for like 2/3 days after, my skin just feels and looks rejuvenated, no dullness. The price for the full product is a bit hefty but the results from the sample have been considerable. Will purchase full thing soon.",1
"I love masks and love some PTR products. While this mask does seem to be slightly soothing to red/itchy/irritated areas, it does not seem to be hydrating or refreshing at all. I have oily skin and in fact seem to be dryer after rinsing away this product. Not impressed - there are other hydrating masks out there that are much much more effective than this one. Given the lack of results, I think the price is absolutely outrageous. Save your money!",0
"I got a deluxe sample of this a while ago. While I wont say it leaves my skin feeling super hydrated it definitely helps put some moisture back in. I usually use this after other masks that can leave my skin with that tight feeling or if I have some dry spots due to acne products. It does make a difference in how my skin feels. I even leave a light layer on overnight once in a while. Not sure yet if I will buy the full size. I think a very hydrating moisturizer, or face oil, can do the same thing if not better.",1
Got this in the Mask A Holic kit.,1
"It works so good, my face actually looks lifted and my laugh lines reduced DRAMATICALLY and it has been one or 2 weeks. I use in conjuction with PTR's orangecolored cleansing gel. This product shrinks my pores,left my desert dry (some peeling) skin better than it was before it had even begun peeling,and my whole face looks younger. Mind you I totally just expected it help with dryness a little, I was definitely happy and surprised haha. I definitely recommend. A lot of cream moisturizers are too heavy and it's difficult sometimes to find one that one break me out ;I recommend gel moisturizers with combo skin and use of natural oil on parched areas.",1
"I fell in love with this product from the 1st time i applied. I left it on overnight. I also use it on the weekends, leave it on all day/night. My skin has never been so smooth/flawless in my life! My skin stays free from dryness for days after use. I leave it on for long periods of time and recommend doing so for excellent/beautiful results!",1
I leave this mask on for at least 15-30 minutes to get super soft skin! My only complaint is this mask tickles my face in an annoying way when it's drying. It must just be the gel detoxing my pores but seriously *lol*,1
How can a mask be hydrating and detoxifying at the same time? Magic. This mask is magic.,1
"This mask feels like you're spreading aloe vera all over your face. It's cool, refreshing, and after I rinse it off my skin does feel hydrated and soothed. My roommates have commented that my skin ""glows"" after using this product. I also have problems with under-eye bags and puffiness. This mask doesn't help with the purplish bags but the puffiness is reduced by basically 100%!I like to use this mask after washing with Peter Thomas Roth's Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel (since it tends to dry out my skin so much). I really don't have any complaints about this mask except for the price! I imagine you could get an equally effective face mask for a cheaper cost.",1
"Have used for redness, dryness, post microdermabrasion, and even razor burn on legs. Saw immediate results for all of these problems. Made them disappear!",1
"I am a mask fiend, and have a collection of beauty product that would rival a beauty editors. I have sensitive and stubborn skin and this is hands down the best product I have ever used, hands down, period. The mask is meant to detoxify and hydrate but where I put it to use and see the best results is eliminated redness and calming zits, or irritate skin ( I know picking is bad but we all do it) and fear not because now you can leave the bathroom without a blotchy red face....this product is a godsend!",1
"Although I sometimes use this on its own for extra hydration, I mainly use it after masks that make my face very red. I have acne so I use a bentonite clay mask once a week. After I take it off my skin is SUPER red. It can also be pretty drying in the winter. I just slather this stuff on (I keep it in the fridge) and leave for ten minutes then rinse with cold water. The redness is practically gone and my skin isn't bone dry. I definitely still have to use moisturizer though. Haven't tried it as an overnight moisturizer yet.",1
"I am on my first container of this and I am in love with it! I believe in investing in skin care instead of solely makeup, so I take what I buy seriously. I have oily/combination skin, that is fair, semi sensitive and acne prone- that's where this stuff has been a holy grail for me. It's incredibly calming and soothing when I have a flare up on my face. When i break out, I do my normal skin care routine, then use this as the final step before I go to sleep at night. When I wake up, my skin is brighter, the redness from the break out has significantly gone down and my skin is way less irritated. My face feels hydrated, but not oily. There is no residue. Having oily skin, I tend to get a dull complexion a little more quickly than others- this is awesome after exfoliation at night to fight that as well. I don't like to use acne products, because it dries out my face and well.. I'm 29 and I want to keep my face wrinkle free for as long as I can. If you're not sure about buying this product, definitely buy the small size and try it. You won't regret it.",1
"Makes my skin so calm, takes away the redness and makes it soft and smooth. I leave it on overnight and wake up with beautiful skin!",1
"GREAT PRODUCT! I never heard of this product until the Macy's retail lady told me she used it everynight. I was skeptical because I'm used to the peel off masks... but I wanted something new. OMG I love it! I noticed a difference with one use! My face gets really dry after washing so I used this gel right after and my face became hydrated and smooth!! I ever used it on my boyfriend and was suprised with the outcome! If you have dry skin, this is a must have!",1
"I already loved this mask, but I found another reason to love it when I put it on my chapped nose after a cold. It cooled the area on contact and soothed the irritated skin. Apply a thin layer and leave it on as you would if you were using this as a overnight masked. Worked wonders on my poor nose.",1
"My super oily skin gets seriously dry between December and March. This mask has been a lifesaver. Cools my dry and irritated skin, leaves it feeling fresh and soft with making it oily. Great for winter wind burns.",1
"I don't generally like PTR masks. They aren't worth the price, and I don't mind spending lots of cash for skincare that workworks. That being said, this mask is pretty OK. I've used it around my eye are when I was tired and it perks it up a bit. You can do better, though.",1
I received a deluxe sample for my birthday and I love it. My skin gets really dry during winter especially around my nose and this product keeps my skin smooth and hydrated all day. It's not thick so it sits nice and light on the face. I use it daily and I'm surprised how far the sample has lasted. I'll definitely be buying the full size bottle.,1
"I really wasn't that excited about this mask, but my mind was literally changed my mind after using a detoxifying mask from another brand. It burned my face! In a very desperate attempt, I put on this mask because of its description as cooling, healing, and calming. I'm sure leaving this mask on my face all night saved me from a terrible burn on my face that morning. I cant say its my favorite Peter Thomas Roth Mask. But I know it has a place in my mask family for unforeseen events from now on!",1
"I like this mask. It's very cooling and helps calm my redness, and also makes my skin glassy-smooth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this doesn't irritate me at all, although the initial coolness is a little bit shocking! But after a minute it's very soothing and relaxing, like sitting in a cool pool on a hot day. Which brings me to my next point: this would be spectacular during the summer, especially if kept in the fridge. It was a gift from a friend, so I'm not sure I would buy it for its hydrating benefits during any other season than summer--but it would feel so good if worn when it's 95 degrees out!",1
"Out of all the sample sized masks I have received from Sephora this is one of the only masks I truly like! And actually I love it! I have very dry skin (worse in the winter) but also still get break-outs occasionally, so I guess you could say my skin is sensitive. I use this mask as directed and right after I am done it actually feels cleaner, detoxed, smoother, and hydrated! I'm going to buy the full size soon! It's worth the money if you have irritated and dry skin!",1
"This stuff is pretty good. I got a deluxe sample and have used it a couple of times now. However, I just can't see myself paying $45 for the full size. It's a bit pricey and I use other masks that are much cheaper.",1
I love this mask! I got a deluxe size sample of this mask in a free gift. I used it and noticed how soft and supple my skin was after I used it. The gel is very cooling and is perfect for early mornings before school. I honestly can't go back to any other mask after using this. Defiantly worth the price tag!,1
I have extremely dry occasionally itchy skin and this mask had Made me see great improvement in the hydration and appearance of my skin. After using it daily my skin looks very dewy and youthful without being oily. When you put it on it is very refreshing and instantly cooling. Highly recommend this mask.,1
Love this mask! I use ot 2-3 times per week and it really helps with the redness around my nose and on my chin from seb dermatitis. My skin is so balanced and even toned now and feels so soft. I have combo skin and find this very soothing...I would give it a try!!!,1
"I got this as a sample and figured I'd give it a try. I have normal-to-dry skin and while I don't break out all that often, I have issues with dullness and blotchiness. After I washed this mask off, my skin looked and felt significantly better - incredibly soft and glowing. I will absolutely be buying a larger size; the fruit acids in it (papaya and pineapple) will help even out blotchiness in the long run.",1
I love this product so much and I bought it repeatably for so many times! I have really sensitive skin but this mask always calms my skin instantly,1
"This produce has completely changed my life. I got it as a free sample for my birthday and I instantly fell in love with the cooling sensation you immediately feel as you apply it to your face. When I removed it, I was smitten. Your skin is glowing, clear, and soft for days. I can't recommend this product enough.",1
Definitely calmed my red irritated skin immediately! Not sure about the hydration but the redness and irritation were instantaneous. That for me is a WIN!,1
"I have oily acne prone skin and I received this as a deluxe sample. I found this did nothing for me. I wasn't feeling refreshed after taking it off, my skin didn't improve...That being said, I wouldn't purchase this at all. I feel like this is a more expensive aloe vera gel.",0
"I've only used this mask once and was very pleased with it. My skin is definitely smoother and feels hydrated. My only negative to it is that when you rinse it off, it's kind silky/smooth and you have to massage it away while rinsing. You can't just wash it off quickly. While this isn't a huge deal to me, it does affect my rating a little bit. When it's time to rinse off, I'd like to not have to spend as much time rinsing it off as I do putting it on.",1
"Over the summer I started using a prescription gel to help get rid of acne, and the side effect was horrible, dry, scaly skin. Ever since I've had really dry skin, something I've never had to deal with before. My previous moisturizer was too thick and creamy, causing my pores to clog, little bumps on my forehead, and a greasy skin texture. I've been using this as a night-time moisturizer and I've seen instant results! My skin is tighter, smoother, and I haven't had a breakout since I started using the product. I will be buying the full size again!!",1
"I have oily, acne-prone skin. I received a deluxe sample of this gel and said..why not? I'm glad I did! My skin maintains balanced. It feels supple and hydrated without that oily and greasy feeling! Luv it!!! I give it 5 â˜†",1
"Honestly, product did not do much for me after several attempts. I did not see or feel any difference especially in regards to hydration. I would not purchase and I personally do not think it is worth the price.",0
"I hate giving bad reviews. I got a deluxe sample and was able to get several uses out. My overall opinion is that it didn't really do much. It didn't irritate my skin and felt refreshing, but aloe could have the same thing for a fraction of the price. I don't dislike the product, but it is not worth buying the full size for me",0
"I have normal to dry skin. this stuff really makes my skin feel much better after it gets dry from the shower. i usually use lotion type moisturizers but this is better then that! it makes my skin feel so smooth, fresh, and plump! I got a sample of this from a purchase online, and you really need a bean sized amount of this.",1
Aloe vera honestly works better. At least for me I didn't notice a change at all in my skin. Didn't make my skin worse though. Would definitely not suggest paying for this.,0
"I am a dry and sensitive skin, and this mask do nothing on my skin. The most terrible thing is this makes me can't open my eyes.",0
"I used this product as a 10 min mask and as an overnight mask, both applied generously and saw/felt no noticeable increase in hydration. I'm currently suffering form very dry, flaky, seasonal skin that also has acne flare-ups. The flakes and dryness was just as prevalent as prior to use. My skin was none the softer and the cool water rinse to me is not comforting.",0
"I got this as a deluxe sample in a goody bag. To be honest, I had no particular expectations. It felt a little weird going on, like jelly or something - not like other masks I've tried. Anyway, I waited the recommended 10 minutes and I was pleasantly surprised. My face did feel cool, smooth and most importantly, soothed. I will more than likely purchase this in the future.",1
"I recieved this as a gift and went into using it with a skeptical approach. I have very dry skin so I tend to prefer creamier masks over gel formulas. However, this mask is extremely gentle and is PERFECT for after peels and exfoliation. If my skin is feeling irritated, I just slather this on and leave it for 30 minutes to an hour, and I can definitely see how calming it is. It's so gentle, you can easily leave it on for an hour or more- I do see more of a result when I leave it on longer. Also, it's not heavily scented. As I was reading the ingredients (cucumber, pineapple, aloe, papaya) I was expecting a strong fruity-cucumber smell but the aloe-cucumber scent is very light and hard to detect once on. I would definitely repurchase this. I didn't give 5 stars because the effect is very subtle, and those who do not have a lot of redness, dryness, and sensitivity might not notice any difference.",1
I received a deluxe sample of this and LOVED it! As soon as I put it on i felt my pores waking up! Smells great and feels very smooth. A little goes a long way.,1
"I absolutely love this product, I received it in sample bundle and I'm glad that I got a chance to try it. The product is so moisturizing and I always wear a thin layer overnight and my skin looks wonderful and I always have a glow from wearing it. Also a little goes a long way so you will have it for a long time! I love it!",1
"This mask is indeed soothing and moisturizing, and also quite refreshing. However, I feel like a good moisturizer does a better job than this mask. It does not irritate my super sensitive skin, which is a plus.",1
"i got this as a birthday gift as the NARS lip pencil wasn't available and I'm so happy that i got skincare products .It absorbs well into the skin,leaves it soft and smooth after rinsing. Apply it under ur eyes for some cooling cucumber effect :)",1
"The mask feels amazing. I feel refreshed and my face looks brighter. I learned about the product first through the free mini facial Sephora had at my store so I bought the set. I have combination skin and it makes my skin look brighter and nicer without a greasy after look. However, I cannot give this product five stars because it says that it detoxes my face and I have yet to see a difference in my pores (I use the cleanser beforehand and while it looks less greasy on my t zone I still have blackheads and my pores don't look clean).",1
"I received this mask as part of the Skintastic Mask Magic kit from PTR, and I can say without hesitation that this is definitely my least favorite of the three. Perhaps my skin is not dry, sensitive, or irritated enough to appreciate whatever virtues this mask might have, but for me it felt just like other reviewers have said; expensive aloe vera gel on your skin. No intense hydration or ""detoxification"", whatever that is supposed to be. I'd even say my skin is slightly on the dry side, with the beginnings of rosacea on my nose and cheekbones, so it seems like this mask would be a good fit for me, but I've used it about 3-4 times already and haven't noticed any difference in my skin.",1
"I absolutely love this product. I have VERY sensitive skin so I store mine in the fridge and i use it every night after my normal skin care routine. My skin just drinks up this mask and my skin always looks radiant and moisturized in the morning! Also it lasts a very long time, I've been using it for weeks and it doesn't look like I put a dent in it. Deffinetly worth the $$$$",1
"I'll admit, I've never had to purchase the product because I end up getting deluxe sizes (Sephora birthday perk or promotions codes).....With that said- I love it. I wasn't impressed the first time because I only had it on for like 10 minutes but last night I used it for 20-30 minutes and omg my skin felt amazing after rinsing it off. I love that the scent is mild and it feels like a very mild formula. I think it would be very nice to use after an exfoliator. Very happy with this product.",1
"This mask does absolutely nothing but sit on the skin. After washing it off my skin looks the same as it did before. Can't believe it because this is a 45 dollar mask, I was expecting more out of it but seriously such a waste of money. The sephora mud mask for $19 is incredible. If you're looking into this, go read the reviews on that. It's wonderful. This did nothing for my skin. Returning!",0
"I've been wanting to try this for a while, so I was happy to get a small jar in a PTR gift set when I redeemed my VIB points. It felt nice and cool on my face when I applied it but the feeling was short lived. After about 10 minutes it was absorbed into my skin and I didn't really notice anything different. I have combination/dry skin and my skin didn't feel moisturized or softer at all, just kind of tight. To be honest it doesn't feel any different from cucumber aloe gel you apply after being in the sun, so I don't think the price is justified. I've been using it under my eyes because it's nice and cooling but I won't be purchasing.",0
"I use this daily. I use my daily moisturizing oil directly after washing my face in the AM and then I apply a small amount of this mask over it. I have been doing this daily for more than a month and my skin is noticeably softer. My eyes also look less puffy, and it makes my makeup dewy. I love this so much, and definitely plan to buy it again when i run out.",1
"Not worth the price tag at all. It cools and moisturizes while it's on the skin but immediately after washing off it does nothing. I've been using this weekly and haven't noticed any long lasting results. It would be nice for someone who enjoys a simple, relaxing mask just for the fun of it, but don't expect any results after using it. It doesn't moisturize, clean, detoxify, or soothe after it's washed off.",0
This is one of my favorites! It's feels like your skin is cold and tingly as it dries. I've used it on some bad sunburns and left it on for hours. It cooled the burn and helped with the redness.,1
"Not wowed by this after a few uses, but not disappointed either. It's an okay product but not really worth the price.",0
"I've read so many rave reviews on this particular mask so I decided to splurge and buy it. I'm glad that I did. As the instructions suggested I refrigerated it first for a cooling effect and OMG... it felt so amazing and refreshing and although I didn't see the instant results that I was hoping for, I did start to notice a healthier and more hydrated complexion after using this twice a week, for 15 minutes, in about 2 weeks. Now... is it worth the 45? Ehh... I might ask for it as a Xmas gift but I don't think I would pay the 45 for it again lol",1
"I'm having trouble finding a holy grail moisturizing mask. I used this one a handful of times, and it felt like I was applying a version of aloe vera that was less sticky. It was definitely soothing while it was on my skin, but the second I washed it off, all the magical, moisturizing effects disappeared. Would only recommend for those that are fond of gentle, gel masks, but I personally will not be repurchasing.",1
"I have very oily, blemish prone, uneven skin. My skin gets red very easily and anti-acne products exacerbate my redness and produce flakiness. This is my solution!!! I leave it on overnight 3 times a week and I wake up to beautiful, soft, even-toned skin. I slab on a thick layer (almost to the point of being wasteful) and it doesn't break me out! I love love love this product. Great for after-sun too.",1
"I had a huge breakout due to me changing birth control and this helped with that soooo much!! I put it on at night and the next morning I wasn't as red and it minimized the breakouts, definitely my go to spot treatment!",1
"I did NOT think this would work. I have incredibly dry skin. I use this mask twice a week for about 15-20 minutes and my dry skin just vanishes. I can even use powder makeup again! I know it's pricey, but it's definitely worth the money.",1
"I don't get this mask, it doesn't seem to do anything!!!! I live it on, as a moisturizer but it doesn't really moisturize",1
"Wasn't wowed after first use, so I'm not interested. Received this as a sample and thought I'd use it in replace of my usual mask after exfoliating. Regretted that decision because this mask didn't yield any results.",0
"This is kind of a strange product. I purchased it thinking it would be a good lightweight moisture mask. It says that it hydrates but on my dry skin it doesn't really hydrate at all. It sinks into the skin and absorbs completely after about ten minutes, and leaves my skin feeling tight and dry. I'm not sure what they mean by detoxifying, but I haven't noticed any difference in my pores or blackheads. One thing this IS good for, is that it is very soothing and has a cooling sensation when you put it on. Because of this, I like to use it after exfoliation or if I've had a little too much sun. The downside is like I said it absorbs quickly, so the cooling/soothing effect is short lived. The directions also say that you can use this as a light layer over moisturizer, which I do after my nighttime routine. It does seem to make my skin feel a little softer in the mornings, but not so much that this is a must-have product. I'll finish the jar I purchased but I don't think I will buy again.",0
"I had always stuck with an avocado clay mask until I got this cucumber gel mask as a sample from Sephora. I have pretty normal skin so I didn't expect much from this product but seriously, it is amazing. I always have a few zits or trouble spots, but not any huge breakouts. Any zits I had are gone and my pores are noticeably smaller plus my skin is very smooth. It's so refreshing to use this mask after a long day wearing makeup and it really detoxes your skin. I was so impressed that I bought the full size. I use it almost every night and will continue to buy and recommend this product.",1
I received the trial size for my bday and so far I think it's pretty good! I didn't get the cooling feeling so I'm thinking about putting in the fridge for next use! When I washed the mask off my skin was very hydrated and felt super soft! I didn't notice a difference in the redness of my skin (I have mild rosacea on my cheeks). I plan on using this product again!,1
It's an cow quick enlightening mask. I use it in mornings for a day lift mask. It's nice but not amazing,1
"I have combination, acne prone skin with some acne scarring on my cheeks. I use a cleanser with salicylic acid and exfoliate pretty regularly to keep my acne in check but this can be harsh and cause redness. This mask is excellent for calming and rebalancing my skin. I use it twice a week and it takes almost all the redness away. If you get an eyebrow or lip wax, it works amazingly to calm irritated skin and it doesn't clog pores.I use it for 10 or 15 minutes but it says you can use it overnight if you want. But it's really tacky and gel like so I can't imagine anyone doing that and getting it all over their sheets. But maybe I'm just a sloppy sleeper :p",1
Perfect to calm skin after sun exposure. Moisturizes and calms skin. Love it!,1
"If you are on the fence about this mask rather it be because of reviews or price, treat yourself and give this a try! It wears wonderfully on the skin and has a cooling effect as well as not being sticky (which was one of the best things about the mask in my book). Leaves skin refreshed and moisturized without feeling oily or gross, plus a little goes a long way! One of the best masks I have ever tried.",1
"I'm somewhat of a mask fiend, and I've tried a lot of different brands and types, but the Cucumber Gel Mask is my ABSOLUTE favorite. I originally tried this in the Mini Mask Magic kit, which also comes with the rose stem cell mask and the pumpkin enzyme mask, but the cucumber was the definite winner of the trio. I bought the full-sized version as soon as I ran out of the mini size and I've used it every day since. This is really nice if you put it in the refrigerator before applying - feels really cool and refreshing on your skin - but it's still awesome even if you just leave it in your bathroom like I've been doing recently. I use this as my moisturizer, putting it on before bed every night and just rinsing it off in the morning, and I've definitely noticed that my skin is a lot softer and more luminescent. It is worth the price!",1
"It felt soothing and helped to reduce redness after an intense enzyme peel, but I don't think the cucumber gel is really anything special. No miracle results here.",1
I received this product as a birthday gift. And I'm in love with it. My skin feels so calm and hydrated! I need a full version!,1
I don't get it. I read RAVE reviews about this product. I have very dry yet acne prone skin. I am on accutane right now for my acne as my skin is dry and red. I hoped this product would a) calm my skin and b) hydrate. It has done neither. My face is seriously worse since using this product. Disappointed!,0
This stuff is absolutely amazing! Its so versatile and always works wonders for my skin! I use a thick layer for 10 minutes once a week and a thin layer over night 2-3 times a week and my skin looks soooo good! its so plump and hydrated and my eyes arent nearly as puffy after i use it. I also use it on sunburns and it instantly feels much better! Highly recommend trying this mask!,1
This stuff rocks! It really rehydrates your skin and leaves you feelings refreshed and your skin super soft and healthy. Try putting it in the fridge before use!,1
"This mask is one of the most helpful products for managing rosacea that I've found - even better than some of the prescription medicines for me. If I have a flare up threatening, and wear it over night, the redness is less in the morning. Generally my face is very dry and super sensitive.",1
This is a prefect example of a product that is visually appealing but does nothing.,0
Great product. Does exactly as it says in description!,1
"I use a prescription acne medication which can make my skin flaky and red (while remaining somewhat oily), but without it I have serious breakouts. Whenever my skin starts to get truly terrible, this calms it tremendously. This is one of the only products that reduces my dryness without breaking me out or exasperating my oiliness.",1
"great for sensitive skin. It helps irrigated skin calm down so if you have a sunburn on your face, this mask will help. and to make it even better put it in the freezer for a little bit or just keep it in the fridge",1
"I got the little sample size for my birthday pack and I love it!!! It actually works well with burns, because I've been using it on my healing burn and there is no irritation whatsoever.",1
This helps me with my mild rosacea. It helps calm my skin down. The only thing I wish is that it was a little more moisturizing.,1
"I was highly skeptical of this mask. I thought, ""Eh, it'll feel good but not really do anything."" So wrong. After the first time of use my skin looked more even in tone than it ever has. It was baby soft and even had a nice glow. Love love love. Especially applying it on a hot day/night after it's been sitting in the fridge.Will definitely be buying the full size when my sample runs out!",1
"I have sensitive, reactive skin that is prone to hyper pigmentation and scarring. I use this mask after waxing or using the Boscia peel-off masks to calm the redness and inflammation. It absolutely delivers what is promised. I leave it on for 30 min and by the time I wash it off, the red splotches have vanished. Fantastic product.",1
This greatly reduces my pores ( I have noticeable ones) and makes my skin feel amazing. It is also very hydrating but does not make my skin greasy. I really do love the way it makes my skin look. I use it every other day.,1
Smells nice feels good.. I use it after a skin peek and exfoliating .. Puts hydration and life back into face noticeable and instantly.. It's not harsh at all and can even spread a thin layer on your face and leave it on without washing off.. Holy grail,1
I do not have sensitive skin by any means and i decided to give this a try and as soon as i put it on my face began to tingle and then burn,0
"I love to use this mask after my Ole henriksen power peel. I actually keep it in the refrigerator and when I apply it it's cold and very refreshing. The next morning my skin is bright and feels very moisturized. I also like to use this around my eyes to reduce puffiness, since I'm a cry baby. :)",1
"I use it at night around my eye area to add some hydration, but not to the point of where my eyes will get too oily. I think it works best if you use it in the following ways.",1
I already felt my skin was hydrated after using the mask once. Very impressive.,1
"I received a mini jar of this product in the Peter Thomas Roth rewards kit. It's amazing! Upon the first use I noticed a different in the texture of my skin; it locked in much needed moisture and made my skin glow. The gel was very cooling, calming and has a very pleasant smell. I have extremely sensitive skin (sun allergy) and I had no adverse reactions. I will be buying the full-size when I run out of my trial.",1
I have used this Cucumber Mask for the past two years to soothe my skin and get rid of the red flush and heat from rosacea. No burning even my sensitive skin. I use many of Peter Thomas Roth's products and my skin has had no issues with his products.Cucumbr Mask,1
"So refreshing. Perfect for after sun exposure. Any kind of burns, chemical peels, waxing. This mask not only calms, cools, and soothes but its detoxifying. Helps with acne on face and body.",1
Got this product with my free birthday gift. I expected more cooking and calming with this product but it didn't really do that much. My skin felt soft afterwards and refreshed. Not worth the price imo but it was free so I like it,1
Personal tip: Keep it in the refrigerator for full effect.,1
So I have used many masks and this one is one that I will always have! It's helped my skin heal from a reaction to a peel too much sun and so far anything that has irritated my skin has been helped by this mask! I highly recommend it!,1
"I use this on days I know I'll be using either matte makeup or harsh makeup removers to get my skin soft before and after the dryness it might develop. Feels great on the skin, you don't need a lot, good amount of product, smells nice!",1
"I have tired a sample of this product twice now and I really do love it! I love to venture out and try new products and sadly, my skin doesn't love trying new things as much as I do so my skin will either have an allergic reaction or get really irritated with bumps and redness. This products removes redness and stops the itchiness along with the swelling. I would definitely recommend this product!",1
this really wasn't really a game changer for me...it is fairly hydrating though...feels kinda like putting aloe gel on my facebut its really good for the cali summer ..<which is almost all year round haha >,1
"Unfortunately I'll probably be returning this product. Leaving it on for 10 minutes as directed did absolutely nothing for me, even when placed in the fridge. Overnight gives a much better result. The next morning my skin looked much brighter with a more even skin tone and was more moisturized, but it seemed to break me out a little bit. The cucumber cleanser is holy grail so I was hoping this would be too. Oh well :(",1
"This product has been a grower for me. After a great deal of experimenting I've found that this mask is best when used in combination with other treatments. I like to use a layer following an intensive mask/peel. It also comes in handy for soothing the skin if I've gone a little too far with my acne products. It helps calm the skin down nicely without the heavy feeling of a moisturizing cream. Don't expect this mask to work miracles on its own, but it could be a great compliment to your routine.",1
"I LOVE this mask! I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews but I am so glad I went ahead and bought it. It is so cool and refreshing, especially when chilled in the fridge. Great for a quick eye depuff in the morning also. If you are looking for a cool, refreshing mask this is it! I'm not sure if there is a long term effect to using it, but I mainly wanted it to soothe my skin at night and give it moisture after my detox mask.",1
I don't think this has improved my skin at all. I have not felt any moisturizing effect. Left it on overnight once and woke up with pretty dry skin!,0
"I have mild rosacea and cystic acne and am currently going through treatment for my acne. The medications and face washes of course work, but using this daily after cleansing and toning has made all the difference in the size of my bumps, texture of my skin, and redness of my overall complexion. No, of course its not going to completely subside all of these things, nothing but medication can, but it definitely aids in speeding up my recovery time. Not to mention it leaves my face feeling plump and hydrated afterwards!",1
"This did feel cooling on the skin but it did nothing as far as hydration, de puffing or calming. Don't waste your money, buy aloe.",0
"I have only used this a few times so far from a sample I received but seems to works great for super dry skin. Leaves it feeling so soft, smooth & hydrated. Will definitely purchase this.",1
I didn't really feel like this product did anything... except maybe cause some bumps on my cheeks.,0
I'm typically happy with Dr. Gross products however this cleanser does nothing for me other than smear make-up around. Really upset to the foaming cleanser is no longer available in the US.,0
"I was using the Dr Dennis Gross acne foaming face wash. My skin alternates between breaking out and dryness. As soon as I switched to this cleanser with toner, my skin flakiness was gone. I need to be careful about limiting the time with the cleanser (due to dryness on my cheeks) but it seems great.",1
"I have moderate dry skin. and the only reason I got this cleanser as it said it is 3 in cleanse and tones at the same time. but the instruction tells u to use it with dry hands put it on a dry face.... it doesn't lather, it doesn't give me the clean feeling as a reg cleanser does. I couldn't return it as I had thrown the box out.",0
Probably just not right for my skin type (combo/sensitive) but incorporating this product had no visual results other than drying out my skin.,1
I use this in combination with the exfoliating pads and the moisture cushion moisturizer and its AMAZING! Cleared up my acne and is not overly drying.,1
"It's a light cleanser. I use it in the morning to remove the excess oil I have. I have oily/ combo skin. When I use it my skin feels soft,clean and refreshed.",1
It made my skin really dry and I had apply twice as much serum and moisture to fix the dryness... I ended up returning the product,0
"Keep away from your eyes, the packaging says. So I do. I was instructed to wash beforehand with the Sephora brand Oil Wash to get all eye makeup and foundation off. So this cleanser is leaving certain areas of my face too dry for my taste. But I feel that it works well otherwise. No residue after I rinse off, which is a plus.",1
I found this product bc the sales rep for Dr. Dennis Gross was in Sephora that day and gave me a week long sample to try. After a week of use I went back to buy the product. I use it each morning as the first thing I put on my face and it's been great! It is a gentle start to my morning skincare routine that does not require harsh soapy cleansing on my already clean face. It's an all-in-one toner/cleanser so it saves time and makes my skin feel clean. I use a more soapy cleanser at night to get all my make up but this is perfect for the morning. I have been using it for two years now.,1
I have combo skin tending towards dry in spots. This is strong enough to clean without irritating my dry spots. At the end of an average day it is enough to wash with this followed by moisturizer. I also use clarasonic Mia. If I am wearing heavier makeup or waterproof eye makeup I do need to use a cleansing wipe first to get my face really clean.,1
I'm a skincare junkie and I've own so many cleansers. This cleanser is the worst it didn't take off my foundation at all and made my face feels dirty n gross that I had to go in with another cleanser. Do not buy!!,0
"I admit, I'm lazy when it comes to always washing my face. I received a sample of this cleanser and ended up buying it after a couple days. A cleanser where I don't have to get soapy water on my shirt, hair and dripping down my neck, perfect! Plus this cleanser gets all my makeup off, foundation, blush, eye makeup, buhbye! I do, sometimes need a little extra to get stubborn mascara off, but this has become my HG cleanser, and it lasts a long time, one bottle takes me about 4 months to go through.",1
"I have dry combo skin, and was looking for something to help with that in addition to preventing/aiding my hormonal breakouts. Unfortunately, this didn't really do anything for me as far as making my dry skin feel more moisturized and it didn't take off my makeup very well - you definitely have to cleanse or use micellular water beforehand. I also thought I would be able to get used to the fact that it didn't leave my skin feeling squeaky clean, but I just couldn't. It will be going back, but I still love Dr. DG :)",0
"As a person with a life long history of skin issues, I was so happy to have this recommended by a skin care expert at Sephora. I have been using it for two years now and I love it. gentle enough for the dry areas and strong enough to conquer my oiliness. I used something else a few times and went right back to blemishes and flakiness. Loving Dr Gross and Sephora!",1
"Not the best, not the worst. Have not noticed a real difference",1
"I have pretty good skin, but it's combination skin, so certain washes are too drying, which makes my face super oily as it tries to compensate for the loss of moisture, even after I apply a moisturizer, or other ones are too mild and don't do any good against my big pores and occasional break outs. This stuff is amazing. My skin feels soft all day long, plus any potential pimples I've had pop up, it's cleared up within 2 days. I've only had this product for about a week, but I'm already raving about it to my friends",1
"This is a good basic cleanser that I've been using for about 4 months. Just one bottle has lasted me this long. It doesn't dry out skin like other cleansers sometimes do. I have mild acne on forehead, chin, and jawline. I stopped using it for 2 days and my skin freaked out badly. I've been using it again on a normal basis and my skin is back to normal.",1
I love this cleanser more than any other that I have ever tried! It leaves my face clean and glowing but not dry ... I am a huge product testing person but I am in LOVE with Dr. Dennis Gross' skincare line!!,1
"Read about this cleanser in a blog post somewhere and I'm sure glad I did! I definitely have go-to toners, exfoliators and mask, but wasn't finding a cleanser I LOVED... Until this one! I have a cleanser I like for summer, but our skin is so different during the summer and winter! It's pretty different to get used to since you don't use water, but I actually really love it now that I'm used to it! The consistency is awesome and I love that it's not super scented! It didn't take very long for me to fall in love with it either! Makes my skin feel clean and supple, but not squeaky clean and dry like other cleansers do! Highly recommend it!",1
Love this cleanser. It takes a little getting used to not adding water but it does a great job cleaning. I don't like using it around my eyes (it isn't great at getting mascara off) so I start with eye makeup remover and then cleanse the rest of my face. My skin looks great after using a couple of weeks.,1
"I have sworn by this ONE cleanser for OVER a decade - it removes any leftover makeup residue ( I use makeup remover too) & cleanses, tones in one. You are left with soft skin that never feels dried out - but is CLEAN.",1
"I love this cleanser!! I have been using it for a month and I think it is great. I know it is weird to rub it in your face like lotion, but once you get past that - you can see what a difference it makes. If I'm wearing makeup, I will wipe off my makeup first and then use this cleanser to wash my face. Sometimes I wet my fingertips a little bit because it can dry out a little before I'm ready to wash it off and I want to keep working it in. When I rinse off my face, it feels really clean and there are no makeup streaks left on my towel. This is an overall great product that leaves you feeling refreshed and gives you soft pretty skin!",1
"I don't write many reviews on this website, but I have owned this product since Feb and I finally just had to rate it, because it works so well for me. I have always had really oily skin and have found few things to help combat that (especially when I'm in humid climate!). I've been using this cleanser inconsistently (mostly because the cost was very high for me) for a few months. I have never found anything that cleaned my face so well without being harsh or giving me some sort of allergic reaction. It was a hassle to get use to using it dry, but you get use to it. I rub it in before I get in the shower and keep my face away from the water as I work it into my skin. Unlike with many facial products, especially those for oily skin, my face never feels tight or dry. My face never feels oily or greasy after I use it either. It always feels soft and clean. It works well to get off my makeup, even waterproof. I never thought I could love a face wash so much, but it is just magic.",1
"I love this cleanser and have been using it for over a year. It was strange at first to put it on dry skin but it really takes off all my makeup and does not over dry my skin or make me break out. I am annoyed that sephora lists this product as a $36 value and limited edition, however, because this is not true. The 6 oz size is sold in many stores for $30. Don't tell me I'm getting a deal from your store when I'm not. It's a great product and I will continue to buy it but don't present this to me as a value at $30 when that is the standard price for this size. That's not a nice thing to do to your loyal customers.",1
I bought this cleanser after trying out Dr. Dennis Gross all-in-one cleansing foam but this cleanser did nothing for me. It dried out my skin (I have combination skin) and left it feeling really rough. I used it for weeks without realizing that it was the cleanser doing that to my skin until I switched back to the cleansing foam and noticed a huge difference. Will not repurchase!,0
"This oil is pricey but it lasts a long time and is totally worth it. I love the way it makes my skin feel and keeps it moisturized, an added bonus is that is smells amazing!! I will continue to purchase over and over again.",1
"First off, I have combo/dry skin prone to breakouts and adult acne along my jawline and on my cheeks. I have been using the Ibuki Cleanser by Shiseido until recently I noticed it wasn't cutting it anymore--as if my skin had become used to it. I liked the foaminess of the Ibuki but I knew deep down I was doing more harm to my dry skin than good. So, I started looking around on Sephora.com and stumbled across Olivia Palermo's top picks. She had this cleanser listed as one of the things she couldn't live without. I had always heard good things about Dr DG but never tried anything. I picked this up, and within two days noticed a difference in my skin. I have been breakout free for two weeks now, and I really believe it has to do with this cleanser. Its so gentle, but my face feels so clean afterward. And its amazing at taking off water proof makeup if you just take your time with it and gently rub it into your eyes. Sorry about the long review... but I'm pretty passionate about this product and will continue to use it until it gets ""used"" to my skin like the Ibuki did. (I hope this never happens though!!)",1
"i am sorry but this isn't my thing. its pricey and i don't see any difference in my skin with this. Also, the whole putting this on dry face is very uncomfortable.",0
"In the past 2 months, I have tried 3 different cleansers that have all been unsuccessful on my oily skin. I found myself having to use a face wipe to remove makeup, then the cleanser itself PLUS the Clarisonic (and still had makeup residue on the brush!)THEN I purchased the Dr. Gross All-In-One Cleanser With Toner. Test # 1: No face wipe. To give you an idea, by the end of the work day, my face is oily, and still have the makeup that I applied in the morning (which consists of a mixture of both liquid and powder bronzer, plus blush, concealer and mascara (a base plus the mascara itself). I used this cleanser as directed for 30 seconds. Then, used the Clarisonic over my face to see what colour the brush would be (from left over makeup). RESULT: THE BRUSH WAS SPOTLESS!! This cleanser removed everything!!! Left my skin soft, not tight, and does not make my skin oily. LOVE it!!! Thank you Dr.Gross and Sephora!",1
"This cleanser works great on my combination skin. I use other Dr. Dennis Gross products and really love this new cleanser. It works well and does not dry out my skin, but it still feels clean!",1
"I tried this product on a whim since I already use the Dr. Gross Alpha Beta Peel and have had very positive results. What a great 2-in-1 product! It loosens up all traces of makeup -- even the bits of waterproof mascara left behind that my eye makeup remover should have erased first! When I'm not wearing makeup, this product works great as a cleanser + toner. Usually 2-3 pumps are enough for me, but I'm not heavy-handed with my makeup in the first place. It leaves my face feeling clean and comfortable, not tight or dry. You don't need a high foaming lather with harsh surfactants to remove makeup - this lotion on dry skin method works great!",1
"This is one of the best cleansers I have ever used! It makes your face feel clean and does not dry it out. You put it on when your face is dry which seems unusual but it's nice and light. It has helped clear up the pimples on my 11 year old daughter too. I'll never use another brand! I've recommended it to many people, it's pricey but you only need a little bit and a bottle can last a long time.",1
"this has completely replaced my makeup remover, cleanser and toner. I find 3-4 pumps can get all my makeup off, no matter how much i'm wearing, and it leaves my skin so clean and soft. my skin is very dry and it's been so nourishing.",1
"This is a very very very good cleanser! Trust me! I was surprised, but it became my favorite cleanser ever! It's worth the price!",1
"This is an amazing underrated cleanser. It takes for all sings of makeup, cleanses the face without stripping the skin %26 is great for sensitive skin as well. It is a cream cleanser and does not foam for those of you who prefer ones that foam. I've had this for months it's lasts forever as well , you get your money's worth .",1
"This is the one and only face wash that takes ALL the makeup off my face (including waterproof mascara), it leaves my skin flawless, my pores reduced and it is just the perfect one step face wash. I have extremely sensitive skin (with red patches). This wash is very gentle as well potent. Also, it leaves no residue and my skin feels soft, and bright. It does sting my eyes a little bit but nothing outrageous just like any shampoo. After this step I apply moisturizer: at night-time I currently use Dr. Dennis Gross vitamin C serum and for day-time I use FAB Ultra Repair.",1
I love it. It does not make my skin feel dry after using it.,1
This is by far my favorite cleanser and perfect for my skin type. My skin is really dry in the winter and a bit on the oily side in the warm weather. No matter what season this is my go to. I had small red bumps in between my eyebrows and this really cleared them up! Love this product!,1
"I bought this by accident thinking it was the foam cleanser. I have oily/combination, easly to break out face with blackheads from time to time. This is more for someone with dry skin. I cnanot knock it since it was not meant for my skin type.",1
"Notice HUGE improvement to my skin. Had very clogged pores and under the skin flesh color bumps on my checks and foreheads, they have cleared dramatically! Very easy to use and leaves my skin smooth and not dry. I use this along with an exfoliant from a different brand.",1
"I noticed a difference in my oily skin appearance after 2 days of using this cleanser. I have less clogged pores & that bumpy look. Impressed to say the least! Very gentle yet thoroughly cleanses. My skin feels perfect. Not dry, tight, or any leftover residue. Very happy! Definitely will be checking out more of the products in this line.",1
"This is by far one of my favorite cleansers. My face feels clean and not stripped after washing. I like that it has an added toner in it. To be honest, I don't know if I notice it that much, but it's an added bonus.",1
this product takes off make up without stripping my face...i use it along with philosophy micro scrub,1
The rep talked me into this at the VIB event. It slightly stings my eyes and does NOT remove makeup nearly as well as she claimed. I do not ever use facial cleanser it to remove eye m/u except cleansing oil. Good thing. This would be a total mess. I have other cleansers I like much better for less $$. If I do not use a cleansing oil first I feel that I need to cleanse twice with this. At least that is what my rinsing cloth tells me.,0
"Love: Perfect cleanser no more words.Hate: Not for good use with clarisonic.Warning: This cleanser is perfection if you don't have the clarisonic but I do and I really benefit from it and so I had to return this cleanser but I would totally reconmd it, because it DOESNT make your skin red or irritated and im combination and it doesn't make you dry or feel stripped.",1
"This cleanser gets off my makeup, gets my face very clean, and doesn't dry out my skin. I've never used a cleanser that didn't dry my face out, even cleansers specifically designed for dry skin. Yes, I still need moisturizer, but my face doesn't have that tight, pulled feeling I usually get from other products. If you wear a lot of eye makeup, you'll need a separate makeup remover for that, but everything on my fave comes clean, no problems.",1
Leaves skin feeling clean without drying it out. I've used it for a week and can see a difference in the clarity of my skin over all.,1
"It's a great cleanser for the morning to wake me up and when I get back from my daily bike ride after work. I don't wear too much makeup, mostly just a tinted moisturizer, and it does do a great job and removing that. However it's not as good as removing eye makeup. It leaves my skin feeling soft and slightly moisturizer in that my skin isn't craving for some lotion afterwards.",1
Great at cleansing the skin especially if you wear makeup. Does not dry the face out too much if you have sensitive dry skin like me. Does not have a smell so great for people with sensitive skin.,1
"I bought this because of the high ratings, and because I love a moisturizer from the same brand. I did not get the same results as others - it leaves behind bits of my (non-waterproof) eyeliner and mascara - like smudges. It is good in that it is not drying, but there are better products for me out there, and definitely less expensive ones. I would not spend my money on this again.",0
I started using this cleanser after I had a good experience with the alpha beta peel. It's the first cleanser I've used where I feel like I genuinely clean my skin without my face feeling extremely dry/tight afterward. I've struggled with acne for years and would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a new cleanser gentle enough for sensitive skin.,1
"This is truly an ""all-in-one"" product. It gently removes my makeup (even my eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, but never dry. I have tried other products, but nothing compares.",1
"I really only ever used water to wash my face, because soaps make my skin feel terrible, but a Sephora employee recommended this, along with the Dr. Gross peel pads, for my pores that seem to have become enormous overnight. I have to admit, I have seen a really big difference in the quality of my skin in the last two weeks, and the product feels good to use. My skin looks brighter and clearer, and I get fewer pimples (usually caused by me touching my face all day). My skin feels a little tight after cleaning, and I use the retinol stuff that comes with the peel pads, and it feels great, and not greasy like lotions do. It's a big bottle, and you don't need much!",1
It smells heavenly when I put it on. I can smell it hours after I apply. A little goes a long way with and it doesn't feel greasy on my face.,1
I am a strong believe in using an oil treatment as a moisturizer. I bought one of the sephora pacakages which included this product. I think it is just okay. I find there are other more effective oils. It is minimially hydrating and I wasn't really impressed with the overall product. I would not buy again.,0
This is a great non pore clogging oil that smells heavenly. The container it comes in could be designed to be more user friendly. I did notice mild reduction in fine lines and my skin felt so soft after using for 2 weeks. It also did not break me out or upset my sensitive skin! Keeper.,1
"This is a nice hydrating oil, and it smells like coconut. However I wasn't wowed by it, so for me the price isn't worth it.",1
"This oil smells wonderful. However, it was not hydrating enough for my dry skin. But a good oil. Is a bit expensive though!!",1
"First of the scent is absolutely AMAZING ! A cross between jasmine and gardenia so I can basically just spend my entire morning and evening smelling the bottle. However I'm not sure if it's really doing anything other than satisfying my nose. It's does sink in quickly so I'm not waiting forever to moisturized and yet it doesn't leave my face ""oily"". Probably won't repurchase but will DEFINITELY try more of her line. I will go back and view more of Carol Hirons in YouTube she gives awesome beauty advice LOVE HER !",1
"I would not recommend this oil to people who live in very cold and dry weather and expect enough hydration for your skin. However, this is the best oil for people who are combination/oily who have experienced some breakouts. This oil will calm it down and doesnt feel greasy when you wake up.",1
"The beautiful rose/floral scent of this oil makes you want to use it all over your body. I have dry skin and find that I need less moisturizer after using this. It is lightweight, doesn't leave an oily feel, but doesn't disappear either. It doesn't do miracles, but works as well as all other oils I've tried, and nothing I've tried has smelled better. Yum!",1
"I love the scent, reminds me of bazooka gum. I've been using this as my morning moisturizer.",1
"My all-year-around, everyday staple. I have oily to combination skin and this dilo oil perfects my skin. I can't live without this oil. It restores the dryness with moisture and evens out my oilyness. This oil has also corrected my acne spots and evened out my skin tone. I LOVE THIS OIL.",1
The best thing about this product was the aroma! It really did not do much for me. I think it might be good for a younger person who has slightly oily skin. I gave it 3 stars because it is a good product just not the right one for me. Sorry to say I did have to return it. I like Sephora's return policy because there's no risk on an expensive product if it doesn't work out.,1
I love the Dilo oil but I do think that the price point is pretty high. I don't think its as effective for combating wrinkles or line and I do not see a difference with that. I think its the best smelling oil but it is only good for moisturizing and helping the skin look supple. It can even be used in your hair. Good for moisture but not for extreme dryness. The oil is extremely light and is clear.,1
I usually use this stuff in my night time skin care routine. I like to mix it in with my moisturizer for better absorption and boy do I love it!! The greatest thing about this product is that it does fade my dark spots that I had from acne. I have been using this for a year and will continue to use it..yes it's pricey but to me the results are worth it.,1
"I have tried a few oils, and this is about average compared to the others. My main issue is the smell. Many of the other reviewers love the smell, but I just can't stand it. It is very strong and sweet. Maybe it would be interesting on pancakes, but I don't like it on my face. It is also thin and kind of greasy. Thicker oils seem to absorb into the skin better. This sort of creates a sheen over the face. I only use it at nighttime, so this isn't an issue for me. But, I'm not sure the beneficial ingredients are making it into my skin cell layers. That being said, my pillow is looking pretty plump. It does have the affect of making my skin more moisturized in the morning when I wake up.",1
"I got a nice size of this oil in one of the sets and the smell is amazing - faint jasmine, my favorite. It also absorbed very well on my combination skin.... but after using it for a few days I noticed dry irritated patches in the crevices of my nose.. I'll continue use it only on my chest and hands",1
Very light oil that has a nice scent and full of good ingredients. Doesn't feel greasy and absorbs well into the skin. Rather pricey though so I use sparingly which is made simple because the oil is dispensed with a dropper.,1
"I really wanted to like this product. There have been so many positive reviews about, and it came highly recommended by the BA at the store. Though it has a pleasant smell, and it feels very pleasant upon application, it leaves an oily sheen behind. At first, I thought I was applying too much of the product, so I decided to use only one drop on my entire face... Nevertheless, I still looked oily all day. I thought I was being paranoid until a coworker came up to me and said, ""darling, you look a little oily today, I have some powder if you want to use it"". That was the day i only used one drop! Yes, I tried wearing foundation and powder over this oil to reduce the shine, however I found that throughout the day the oil seemed to break my foundation down and by the end of the day I had hardly any foundation left and my setting powder seemed to have settled In my pores. I experiment several days with this oil under my foundation and each time experienced similar results. Although, I do believe this is a well formulated oil, and I do enjoy the process of applying it, it just isn't a product that seems very practical for daily use. I can't wear it alone because of the oily residue leaves behind, and I can't wear it under foundation because it seems to break down the formula. It's a shame because it really is a delight to apply.",0
"I'm on my second bottle of this and I'm sure I cannot live without it. I have combo/oily skin and I use this twice a day as my moisturizer. It absorbs so fast so wearing this under makeup is not an issue. I put it on, brush my teeth and then I'm ready to apply my face. I do dampen my skin (like the instructions say to) with caudalie grape water just prior to applying and it feels like a dream. SO soft, SO hydrated and SO non-greasy. The smell is divine; very spa-like. The dropper takes some getting used to but I've mastered it with time.",1
"Do not be fooled! Just because it claims to be for sensitive skin types, does't mean that it really is meant for sensitive skin. While I still get some acne, I am more prone to rosacea ""breakouts,"" which were under control thanks to Sephora's renewing serum (which is no longer available...boo! :(), but I had to find something new. I read reviews, and eventually settled on this product.",0
"I've never been a facial oil person, more into serums. So I gave it three weeks before I wrote this review. It does have an immediate and visible firming effect on my skin. And it has evened out my skin tone slightly. I only use it at night as I'm hesitant makeup may slide off if I use it in the morning. At first, I followed the instruction and only used two drops. That is not enough at all. Even for my combination skin, I need at least 4 or 5 drops (done over the sink as it splatters when the oil comes out of the pump). PLUS I need to put my regular moisturizer on top. The oil has a herbal smell, and it does linger if you use it alone. I'm not optimistic its long term benefits will be greater than what I have seen so far.",1
"I am on multiple skin medications to manage my rosacea, which can really dry out my skin. This oil works great, does not aggravate my condition, and really performs best when mixed with a moisturizer (I just use a very simple drug store brand). Its lighter than a lot of other oils that I've tried, and has a nice scent.",1
"I'm obsessed with this oil. I actually look forward to putting it on twice a day. I love the smell, the feel and the way in makes my skin glow! I like the dropper. If you are careful there is no waste. If I have too much out I just put it on my hair ends. If it wasn't so expensive, I would use this all over, but I'm saving it for face, neck, chest....and hair ends. I've been using JM Argan Oil for several years, and this oil just replaced it.",1
"I got this product a while ago as a sample that came with something else that I bought. Never really thought of using it until this past winter. My skin gets really really dry during winter time and this product has saved my skin. I could never find a good combination of products to achieve the perfect dewy/moisturised skin without it looking overdone or greasy, but this my beautiful friends is worth every penny. I apply it at night as a serum after I'm done washing my face and I apply it, as well as moisturizer, under my foundation and it gives the most amazing finish. If you have dry skin like mine, you will want this product, and it smells like candy ! ah-mah-zing",1
I went in looking for what I thought would be new foundation because my skin looked dry within a few hours. I was shown this product and bought it to mix with my moisturizer. Now my skin looks perfectly dewy! Get it!,1
I was a huge JM 100% argan oil user until I found Kate's Dilo oil. I love this formula and everything about it. It has a great scent and absorbs into and moisturizes my skin perfectly!,1
"I really like the smell of this oil, very tropical. I have been trying it several different ways, mixing with either my moisturizer or with my BB cream. I don't know if it has been reducing lines & wrinkles because I just started using it, but it seems to help add moisture. Skin seems more glowy and it does not bother my sensitive acne-prone skin.",1
"I am in love with this oil. I am 27, fair freckly skin, terrible dark circles, and only recently started becoming obsessive about skincare products when my chin breakouts became more regular/severe. After trying and enjoying a few other Kate Somerville products I wanted to give this stuff a try and I could not be more happy with it.Two days after I started using this my husband said my face was looking great. I couldn't decide which eye cream to try next but just using this and a de-puffing roller has made SUCH a difference I am not even sure I need one... the only heavy makeup I wear is under my eyes but I went all weekend without it! And it has a wonderfully pleasant, light banana-coconut scent.",1
Was given this as a sample in the store one day while shopping for moisturizer that wouldn't make my makeup all damp and wet..... LOVED IT!! So then I had to have some & I continue to be very pleased with my purchase (wish it didn't cost so much but you don't use much either)...,1
"I received a sample of this a while ago and really loved it, so I decided to purchase the full version after I finished my Tarte Maracuja oil. First of all, this stuff smells amazing. I am definitely not a fan of the tropical/coconut smell, but this stuff is exactly that, but much more subtle & luxurious. The product itself really works - it's thin so it dissolves into your skin quickly and gives your skin an extra layer of moisture while not making it overly shiny. Compared to Tarte Maracuja, the Dilo Oil absorbs more quickly because it's thinner, smells better, and might be a smidgen more effective. But because it is thinner, it's not as moisturizing I would say. But neither oil is a stand-alone moisturizer anyway - you definitely need an actual moisturizing lotion after this, especially if you have dry skin.",1
"I have dry parched skin. I exfoliate, then apply Dilo, then I use Korres. Great combination for the winter.",1
I have oily skin.. this oil absorbs in quickly and gives me a great dewy glow. I use this for daytime when I don't want to wear makeup - just have a nice finish to my face.,1
At first I was ready to take it back as I did not see any type of improvement in my skin. I decided to give it a few more days and now I like it. I only gave it a four star as in my opinion it is does not warrant a higher rating. Nice but nothing that made a big difference.,1
"I don't write reviews often but I had to for this!! I absolutely love this oil!! It smells so nice and goes on my skin so nicely!! I'm oily t-zone/normal skin but since the weather has changed I've had some dryness but with this oil, it evens everything out and makes my skin feel like silk!! REALLY!!",1
"This is the best face oil I've tried so far. I live in a really dry and cold climate in Montana and this oil keeps my skin glowing. A little goes a long way, which helps me rationalize the price. Lovely smelling, also.",1
"I received this as a sample at the Nordstrom counter and I've been hooked on it ever since. I have eczema so my skin is very dry all year round, especially during the wintertime. I use this under my moisturizer and it's amaaaaazing. The oil is very lightweight but so moisturizing at the same time. I've also noticed my skin complexion has improved as well. I don't think I can ever do without the dilo oil.",1
"I have tried numerous face oils, and nothing has come close to this Dilo Oil. I absolutely love it. It sinks in immediately - you will be left with absolutely no oily residue (as long as you don't use more than a couple drops, I assume). The smell is beautiful. The softness you are left with is addictive to the touch. I can't think of using any other oil. I had a tiny tiny sample tube that has lasted me at least a month, and just bought the full size. Yes, it's pricey, but I can see this one bottle hanging around for several months. I only use it once a day right before bed and the softness lasts all the way until I wash my face in the morning. Can't say enough good things about this oil!",1
"I love that this oil is light, but I also feel like that's causing me to use more than I should (a bit less than 1/4 of the dropper)! It absorbs fast, helps lighten scars, and it very moisturizing! I have combination skin so this is great! But I'm not sure ill repurchase bc of the price & how much I'm using. I use it at night only.",1
"This is amazing. When asked I was never quite sure how to describe my skin, sometimes a little dry in areas sometimes a little oily, sometimes somewhere in between or normal. This oil makes my skin look and feel great. It is just the right amount of moisture to make my face feel great. I really recommend it!",1
Hands down the best I have ever used. I have tried a ton of different brands. I love the lightness & the smell.,1
"I can't say enough good things about this oil! I tried many, many different oils before I came across a review of Dilo oil online and decided to give it a try. I will soon be purchasing my 3rd bottle and have never strayed. It is a lightweight ""dry"" oil that can be worn over moisturizer or alone, depending on your skin type. Since using it my skin tone has become more even, hormonal breakouts have lessened and my skin just looks better over all. This is my HG product and I really hope they NEVER stop making it!",1
"I have acne prone and sensitive skin. Most moisturizing and oil products cause my skin to breakout with cystic like acne. Horrible. However, being in my late 30's my skin requires a moisturizer and Dilo Oil Restorative Treatment is it! I use this product morning and night, without once ever breaking out from it. My skin feels soft, silky and looks luminous after applying. I will always buy this product.",1
Excellent product! I allow this oil to set a few minutes and follow with KS moisturizer. Gives face a real natural look. Btw: Iightly brush it through the gray wings of my hair across the temple area to help blend with my brown.,1
"This oil was a surprise! Not greasy, but so hydrating. Skin appears more uniform. Yes, the delivery system is a bit awkward but I love the results. I have mature, sensitive skin and I love to mix a drop or 2 of this oil to my existing favorite moisturizer.",1
"I have fairly normal skin. I was a bit hesitant to try this product. I didn't want to risk making my skin TOO oily. That being said, this product completely changed my skin care routine. It's made my skin so soft and really evened out the tone - (I have a very fair complexion & sometimes redness can be an issue). I use this in conjunction with my Bliss exfoliating face wash (using my clarisonic) and my Origins Night-A-Mins facial moisturizer. My skin has never felt better!",1
"I'm a sephora girl. I work, play, create and enjoy all things sephora. This is by far THE BEST deep therapeutic treatment for my skin. This product improved the radiance of my skin in less than 2 weeks. Scars and hyperpigmentation decreased at the 3 week mark of use (2X daily). This lasts a long time and a little goes a long way. This product is gentle and perfect for those wanting to reverse the signs of aging. I give it a double thumbs up! Take it from a pro! A MUST HAVE!",1
"I am 38 and get random bouts of break outs and clogged pores. I've gone through one entire bottle of this product. I was skeptical about oils based on my break outs, but after using this product for several weeks, my skin is softer and I have significantly less breakouts. I also get way less bumps on my face from clogged pores! Love it. I only gave it 3 stars due to the way the product is packaged. It is very hard to only get out a small amount of product and I had it shoot across the room a few times wasting product. Wasted product=my money out the window. Therefore it should be less money because of this.",1
"Love this oil, soaks into skin quickly and is really great at adding hydrating. Made my skin look much healthier. Has a delicious, almost gourmand smell to it that fades quickly when applied to skin. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a great facial oil.",1
I honestly love this oil. Period. I love trying new beauty products and I saw that everyone was using oils and I recently started getting very dry skin and cream moisturizers were not doing it. I thought this might help me in that area. Boy did I get more than just moisturized skin! I mix this with my moisturizer and it has helped my acne marks so much! It is the only thing that I have added to my routine so this has to be the reason. What usually takes almost a month to fade on my cheeks fades completely in two weeks. This really surprised me in helping my acne marks. This has worked very well and I have specifically tried many products to help with that. The only thing I hate about it is the dropper thing. It sticks and there is no way to control how much comes out. You try and it just all comes squirting out and is frustrating. But for how much it has helped me it will deal.,1
"I have trired them all and find this oil to be the best of them. Unlike the others, it is not greasy, sinks right in. I have noticed increase in firmness. It does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. Since I started using this oil I have not worn any foundation - my skin is flawless.",1
"Really pleasant smell, lovely and light and really does the trick. Saved my skin during the bitter winter and not too heavy now that it's spring. Great packaging and the dropper is terrific, much better than some other oils.",1
Absolutely HATE the dropper. It's hard to control how much you squeeze out. It'd be better if they used the traditional medicine dropper..,1
"I have been layering this oil under the Age Arrest Cream for about 3 weeks (I'm not sold on the cream yet, but I'll give it a good 8 weeks before I decide). I tried the Josie Maran Argan Oil, but it broke me out. This oil works wonders on my dry, sensitive skin. I adore the banana-esque scent! My only complaint is the dropper!! It's terrible. The plunger button sticks, so in the beginning it would squirt out everything in the dropper. I now have to squeeze out the dropper in the bottle first, then it is less sticky.",1
"I love how this has diminished my fine lines. My skin looks healthier and clearer than it has in a long time. This oil os not greasy. The only drawback is the dispenser. It is hard to control the amount of product coming out. Still, the benefits outweigh this drawback.",1
a little pricey. I'll probably try other oils first before repurchasing this one.,1
"nothing can compare to this product. makes skin feel smooth, hydrated and dewy. perfect for aging skin. I apply to damp skin, add moisturizer and primer prior to foundation. looks flawless. the smell makes me feel like I'm in Hawaii again!",1
"Bought this product after meeting with a Kate Somerville rep at a VIB Rouge event. I had been using Ole Henriksen, but my sensitive skin was not liking it, ending up with a lot of redness and dry flaky patches. They recommended this product and so far it has worked wonders. It is lightweight and does not leave a greasy feeling on my skin. I have switched this out with the Truth Serum I was using from Ole Henriksen.",1
"I searched and searched for a reasonable price and product. The ratings were good... Sooooo, I started using it at least once daily about 5 months ago. My mom who is not even a beauty person or uses such products told me, ""your skin looks so much clearer and even."" At first use I immediately noticed how soft and smooth my skin was!!I have oily/combo skin, and even though this is a pure oil, it didn't make me more greasy or anything of that sort.",1
"I've been trying this oil for a little over a week. I was really turned off by the scent immediately, but I thought if the product was really wonderful I could overlook that fact. To me it smells really strong and a lot like that fake banana candy scent. Not very pleasant to my nose and not soothing or natural. The first couple of days I thought the texture of my face was improving. No residual oil on my face after it soaked in and my face felt velvety. As the days progressed I noticed my face looking duller and worse than normal and now have large flakey dry areas on my forehead and breakouts around my nose, on my cheeks, and chin. This will be my first sephora return.",0
"I really wanted to love this after all the great reviews and not seeing even one review claiming it caused break outs.My skin is very sensitive, oily in T-zone, prone to clogged pores and break-outs, so I had high hopes this would be my moisturizing solution. I used it for 5 days and each time within the day, new pimples cropped up. My face is a pimpley mess. Also, the oil does NOT absorb well, but sits on my skin all day making my forehead look like a grease slick. The smell is divine, but that's the only part I love. I will return to my Nude oil, which is thicker but absorbs into my skin and doesn't break me out.",0
"I tried this oil because an esthetician suggested I try it. She said it ""transformed"" her own skin. My skin is SO dry from this harsh winter and I consequently break out. The esthetician said the dilo oil would basically trick my sebaceous glands into not needing to produce more oil, and therefore diminish breakouts. I tried this for a week and it really had no effect on my skin. My skin is so dry that after I wash and dry my face, my skin feels as tight as if I had on a dried clay mask on-- I was hoping this oil would help that, but it just made my skin, well...oily. It didn't seem to absorb at all. And because of that, my makeup did not go well over it. It didn't make me break out at all, it just didn't help. I think it would probably work well for someone whose skin isn't as severely dry as mine. On the plus side, it smells amazing!",0
This oil absorbs into your skin so quickly and just leaves an amazing dewy glow. It doesn't make your skin feel oily at all. Oh and it smells amazing. Great oil,1
"I love, love, love this product. I have used several different oils, but this has got to be the best. It is not greasy, it gives your skin a healthy glow and it smells great.",1
"I wanted to use the product for 30 days before reviewing to give it a fair shot.I never used Kate Somerville before. I wanted to try a face oil and after researching them all, this was the only one that said it helped sagging skin.This product made my skin very soft and gave it a refined texture. It also helped the lines around my lips a bit, which was a pleasant surprise. If it had helped with the sagging, I would have given a 5-rating.Non-greasey, smells great. Just wish it helped with the sagging.",1
I bought this products because of the rave reviews. I did not have the same experience. the oilds did on absorbe on my skin well and I feel like the product is over priced. I will not be a repeat customer.,0
"Kate sommerville brings it home again. I love this oil it's light, absorbs fast and make my skin glow. I use it under Kate's nourishing moisturizer. I love it! Totally worth the $ and as far as the packaging goes I have not had any problems ( sorry to those who have though). Other oils I love, argan oil josie maran , rosehip oil and kheils midnight concentrate. All fabulous.",1
"I have been using this product for almost a month in the morning. ( I am also using the Kate Somerville nourish in the evenings after cleanser). This product line was recommended to me by the skin care consultant, after I went in to find something a little stronger to help with winter dryness. I tried a sample in the store, and my skin felt amazing! The oil goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly. I have absolutely no problems with breaking out (huge concern of mine)I am fairly neutral about the packing, I use the dropper as a wand. As it is difficult to Only use 2-3 drops (which is all you need! )Switching my moisturizers has DRAMATICALLY improved my skins health.I highly recommend this product.",1
"I love this oil - it smells amazing, my skin looks great when I use it. It even provides enough moisture for this harsh Northeast winter and its cold cold weather. The only problem is the packaging is completely falling apart. The bottle leaks, and leaves a ring of oil upon anything on which it rests. I'm disheartened, because I love the product so much and I feel like some of it is being wasted in the leak.",1
"I've been using this for about two weeks and my skin is glowing, radiant and softer than ever before. I have dry skin so i've been adding two or three drops of the oil to my moisturizer AM and PM and I honestly noticed a difference my first use. My skin is smooth and it's help minimize my pores(which are naturally large) I've already got my sister hooked as well. Great product.",1
"I got a bottle of this from a contest I won at work, I have very oily, breakout prone skin and brittle dry hair. After 2 weeks of using this on my face and my hair both have inproved dramatically. I wake up feeling so much better. I will definitely be buying this again and have already recommended to my sisters.",1
"I have an oily t-zone and I read that using a facial oil will help control the amount of oil my face produces. Well this has really do e a great job of controlling excess oil in my t-zone and given my skin a renewed look. The first few times I used it my skin looked brighter, more refreshed and moisturized. I have some acne scars around my mouth and haven't noticed any reduction in that area though.",1
"This product is the best Sephora has! That's an enormous statement to make. I shop there frequently, and I have never been more impressed with an item than I have been with this one. It truly does what it claims and more, enjoy!",1
"I received this oil and spent about 5 minutes trying to figure out how to open it up. it works wonderful. My skin is very soft and it smells very nice. The problem lies in the packaging. I actually need to ship this back or get it replaced because it constantly leaks. it leaked all over my bathroom drawer and when I thought it was closed up tightly and I traveled with it, it leaked all over my travel bag. There is a serious issue with the bottle and how it dispenses.",1
"I love this oil. I previously tried the Josie maran and nude oils. I found the JM too greasy, and liked the nude, but didn't find myself using it much.I am in love with this oil. I find myself craving the smell every day. It is not too rich and spreads beautifully. It absorbs quite fast. I have very dry and dehydrated skin that is acne prone and this did not break me out at all. It has really helped keep my skin hydrated. I use it under KS goat milk or age arrest moisturizers. I even mix it with some foundations that I find too dry. I use it twice a day.I find it very luxurious and really a pleasure to use. I would definitely recommend it.",1
"I'm completely blown away by Dilo Oil. It truly does give radiant essence to the skin and is like a beauty elixir for me. It does have a fragrance, but I personally love the scent and find myself craving it during the day, excited to wash my face and use it! I have sensitive/combination skin and was originally given this as a sample in a small plastic flip top jar. It was easy to just tap my ring and middle finger into the jar and then pat my face, used it for about 2 weeks (get a sample first, if you can!) I put a tiny bit in my moisturizer in the AM and let it absorb into the skin very well before primer and makeup. At night I wash with the Clarisonic, use toner, then serum, then pat Dilo oil into your skin and neck (let it absorb and do it's thing!) then moisturizer.",1
"...on top of Algenist serums - smoother skin, smaller pores, lesser lines, less irritation (I've been using it for 3 weeks now) and, contrary to being oil, it leaves skin non-greasy.",1
"The directions for this product say to use 2-3 drops per application but with the design of the applicator, it is impossible to use only that much. I tried carefully each time I used the product to only a small amount, Even so, the dropper would not allow that and I would end up using 5 or 10 times that much, wasting a lot of product in the process. I didn't have a chance to evaluate the product's effectiveness because I couldn't work with the dispenser. Returned.",0
"The smell is just perfect, not greasy at all (i live in a country that has tropical weather and still does not make my face look greasy). I just got it so i have to use it a bit longer before saying anything about the antiaging properties, but so far so good",1
I don't usually write reviews but I felt it to be necessary for this product. I love this product so much. It gets rid of my redness on my face and makes it feel so smooth. I can tell a difference already and I've only had it two weeks. It's also helped with my laugh lines and under eye wrinkles. The smell is soooo soothing as well. It's a staple in my morning and nightly routine now. Worth every penny.,1
"This stuff is amazing! I have been using it for a week now, trying out different night moisturizers for my breakout prone skin. My previous breakouts from the too rich cream I used before are gone and my pores seem to be getting smaller. I was a little worried at first because I thought it would feel greasy but after it settles, your skin feels very smooth.",1
"I love this product! it makes my skin look amazing, and it smells amazing too. I've only been using the product for 6 days and already my pores look smaller, my skin is hydrated, my skin tone has evened out, its getting rid of acne scars that I've had for a couple of years, and the fine lines on my forehead are becoming less visible. After searching for multiple years for a product that could do all these things without irritating my sensitive skin, this product has exceeded my expectations. I am officially obsessed!",1
"I really like this oil. My oily but flaky skin doesn't break out from it and my skin is so soft. I really wish it were packaged differently, though. I don't want to use my hands to screw the cap shut when I have oil in my hand because I don't want oil running off my hands. Setting it down and going back to it in a moment made me knock it over and spill half of it.",1
"I have been trying a lot of new oils lately, but I have to say this one simply takes the cake. It's light on the skin, and smells greats too. I have only used it a few times and already feel so much more hydrated and glowing. I will definitely use this product again.",1
This is a repurchase for me. Love that the new packaging shows you how much product you have inside. Love how this oil absorbs so much more quickly than other oils I have tried. Will keep repurchasing.,1
I'm on my third bottle and still love this product.,1
It's been 2 days and my face is so soft and glowing. This oil is not greasy and is a great moisturizing treatment. I am hooked on Kate's products!!,1
The best treatment I have ever had. Only after one use the skin felt amazing.,1
"The first few times I applied the oil it was soothing, then, after a few days, i had some dry patches even though I applied to damp skin. I started applying it after applying another oil to see if that will help because I do love the feel and the smell. Hope that will help the dry patching.",1
I loveeeee this oil. I had a cold sore on my lip and did some. Research on Dilo oil and in less than a day it diminish the sore and I kept on using it and got rid of it fast! I love this oil,1
"I have just used this a few days so far, and my there is an incredible difference in my face. It is glowing and younger looking. Skin feels wonderful and smooth, not oily.",1
"I couldn't wait to try this. The first time I used it, I thought I did it wrong. The pump dispersed way too much oil into my hands. I like the smell, but end up greasy bc I am using more than two drops each time. The pump is difficult and flippant to use, either I get air or half a bottle. I won't be getting this again, I am not impressed.",1
I am not a big fan of oils but I tried this after reading lots of great reviews and I must say this is the best oil for my dry combo skin especially in the winter time.You only need like 1-2 drops and then you just spread it across your face and there's no greasy feeling it just absorbs. No allergic reactions and it smells really nice. Almost like a coconut or something tropical. Worth every penny.,1
"I've been using the Kate Somerville line for the past four years and the entire line is amazing, however Dilo Oil is just Superb, my skin absorbs it so quickly and it does not leave a greasy feeling on my skin, also I've noticed a significant reduction in lines around my eyes and forehead.",1
"As my title says, I am normal to dry and very acne prone. I go from having no blemishes to having 6 in one area. I started using this oil 4 months ago nightly and using Kate's Age Arrest face cream Am/Pm and my skin has never looked better.",1
"I love this! It's really moisturizing, I had really bad dry, red and itchy skin, and after 2 days my skin is all good an back to normal! It's like a miracle. I absolutely recommend it.",1
"This face oil is like no other oil I've ever tried. It's thinner than all the face oils on the market. It is very moisturizing, absorbs quickly and has a really subtle scent. Never broke me out and has treated some of my recent dry areas of my face due to the cold dry weather this season.",1
"I brought this with me to a recent trip to Thailand, really convenient packaging for travel. I used this to keep my skin moisturized on the plane and it worked well (no dry, flaky skin). Eventually with the humidity there I would either only use this at night or on top of my CC for an added glow, but it kept my skin in balance the whole time. Nice for cuticles, hair that was dry from chlorine and salt water, and I can't say enough about the packaging which is relatively spill-proof. Now I'll always think about my trip when I smell this oil.",1
"I must admit, I was more than skeptical of the face oil trend, especially as a person with acne-prone skin, but to my surprise, I received a sample of this oil from a friend and fell in love! It was perfectly light for my sensitive skin with a very subtle fragrance that I did not find overpowering. Within a few days of use, I noticed my skin seemed softer, brighter, was holding moisture better and appeared to have an improved texture. I purchased the full size shortly after receiving the sample, and am still very pleased. It did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy as I would have expected, but absorbed quickly with a matte finish. I apply two to three drops twice daily either before my moisturizer or mixed in with it. From my experience, this oil appears to treat a variety of concerns that, to me, make it worth the price.",1
I like this oil...a lot. Love the smell. This is a nice hydrating oil. I have problems when oils dry out my face. This one didn't dry out my face. I will purchase this one again.,1
"I do like this oil , I apply it at night over my retin a product. My skin feels soft in the morning. I wouldn't apply it during the day , it would be way too oily for me. Maybe in the winter months if I had some dry skin areas. It has a nice light scent. No parabens in this Kate Sommerville product . I wish all her products were paraben free. NOT tested on animals !!!",1
"My face was very dry with red patches that I could not seem to tame. At the very least, I thought this oil would help with that but I was surprised to see that it has evened out my skin's dark spots as well! I look forward to putting this on in the am and pm as it is so soothing. The fragrance is not great but is mild and goes away quickly.",1
"This oil really gives results you can see. The gardenia smell is very strong, but it's worth smelling like your grandma's corsage to keep from looking like grandma. I have very sensitive, dry, cuperose skin and was thrilled to see the increase in radiance and tone while reducing my redness significantly. I travel frequently and this works in all climates as a night treatment and in dry climates in daytime also (don't forget the sunscreen). It's on the pricey side but you will see results after just a few uses. Love it!",1
"I have tried many oils and was a bit skeptical about this one since Kate Somerville is a ""clinical"" brand that usually specializes in retinols, glycolics, etc., but this oil rivals the natural brands! It absorbs nicely, smells good, and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth! And a little bit goes a long way! Worth the $65!",1
"I absolutely love Kate Somerville's Dilo Oil. I use it on my face, hands, feet and hair. It smells really good too.",1
This product makes my skin feel more moist and smooth. I like that it seals in moisture.,1
I initially tried a sample size of this cream and really liked it! I use it to moisturize my occasional flaky areas (above my lips and around my mouth and nose). I also use it as a nighttime moisturizer. A little goes a long way! This 50mL tube will last me a long time!,1
This is fabulous! My skin loved this. Probably my favourite moisturizer ever. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this worked really well.,1
I am pretty upset with this product. I read all the reviews before purchasing it. I have normal to dry skin and struggle with dry patches. I had read people reviewing and saying it caused their skin to get dry (I always feel like people are dramatic and critical sometimes) so I went with the positive reviews. ,0
Product absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any oily residue. My skin feels clean and fresh after I use it and I would repurchase.,1
"If you're anything like me, I have an abundance of acids, peels, and exfoliants that I try my best to limit use to once every few days. Even then some of them can be quite harsh and take me to the edge of destroying my moisture barrier. ",1
"Reliable moisturizer, reasonably priced, especially great if recovering from over exfoliating. I always keep a tube handy even if I don't use it every day.",1
"This is a great, multifunctional cream. It's lightweight but long-lasting, hydrates with a matte finish, softens skin, evens skin tone with its tint, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. It's a one-stop, do-all product. Highly recommend. Excited to check out the rest of the line!",1
"As someone with an oily T-zone and super flaky skin everywhere else, this moisturizer has truly saved my life. Personally, I enjoy using this the most during the dry winter months, but lately I have resorted to using small amounts of this cream before bed. I recommend using this moisturizer if you frequently use acne treatments, as the Ceramidin Cream can deposit back much needed moisture!",1
This is the best facial cream ever!,1
Ideal for dry skin! doesn't leave the face shiny. I have really dry skin and during the winter I had to find a cream that I didn't have to apply multiple times throughout the day. This moisturizer is bombbbb,1
"I was reluctant to try this product at first but when I first got a mini sample of this from the sephora promos, it was amazing and actually helped with my acne a lot! It feels really soothing and smells very organic!",1
The Ceramidin Liquid & Cream are go-to products for me. It's very moisturizing and never irritates my skin!,1
ideally this is 3.5 stars. this saved my skin when it was really dry and flaking in the winter months. it calmed my skin and make it possible for me to just make facial expression without feeling like my skin will rip. for that i am grateful i tried it. i had been using a drugstore moisturiser with ceramids in it for over two years before i switched to this. i love the feeling of heavy conditioning moisturisers.,1
"this cream has been such a life saver for my dry skin that has become sensitized by too many harsh products. it is thick but not greasy, pleasant scent, and is perfect for soothing skin overnight. I also apply to sunburns and it keeps my skin moisturized while soothing. yes the packaging could use some tweaking, but the quality outweighs any inconvenience. I find myself recommending this to friends and family, I will always repurchase.",1
I use this on top of my retinol at night. makes my skin feel soft and smooth. it's not super moisturizing but hydrates enough.,1
This is my go-to moisturizer. My face is extremely sensitive. It was hard finding a type of lotion I could put on my face before bedtime and not be broken out in the morning. This is the one. It feels so good on the skin and really does it's job. My skin thanked me for this purchase. Well worth the money.,1
"I have very dry skin. I had been using an assortment of serums, moisturizers, and night creams for years trying to achieve the results I got from this cream. I have eczema so I have been religious about moisturizing since I was 16. Not only did I moisturize but I would use a more super exfoliant by Clinique once a week and and a daily exfoliant by Philosophy obviously daily, and I still always had flaky skin and an oily T zone. I bought some Kat Von D foundation that really just magnified my problem skin and it was that foundation that pushed me to find a better routine. I found this and literally the next day my problems vanished! I use it with the ceramidin liquid and have returned all of my other products this is all I need now. I don't have an oily T zone or flaky skin I don't need to use that super exfoliant anymore but I do still use that Philosophy face wash for my own peace of mind. I have never broken out and really this is the product I have been searching for! My skin looks plumper too!",1
"Usually I use Aquaphor for my barrier cream needs but this is even better because it's not greasy or shiny. Great in the winter on dry, chapped skin, cracked heels, etc.",1
"While I didn't see any changes in firmness, it definitely made my skin feel softer without being too greasy.",1
I can tell this is the best cream I've ever used. The texture seems like very oily but never oily for combination skin type. Highly recommended.,1
"I have very dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and this cream has changed the game for me. I never right reviews but I felt I had to spread the word of how good this cream really is. Paired with the liquid its a perfect combo! Its my forever moisturizer.",1
"Whenever I'm having a bad skin day, or my makeup is just clinging to every dry patch on my face, I can always count on this cream to fix it! It works so nicely under makeup my foundation just glides over top, it hydrates my skin the entire day. Usually by noon my skin has already felt dry, EXCEPT when I wear this lotion. It smells amazing, feels amazing, and will be a staple in my skincare regimen forever!",1
i got this in my first birch box and fell in love. i've tried numerous 10+ moisturizers and nothing could compare. this makes my skin feel very soft and hydrated. i have some acne and my skin is combination. this definitely helps with all my skin issues and i am in absolute love. it smells wonderful as well,1
"No matter how many times I try to convince myself that I should test out other creams, this one always comes out on top. It gives the most intense moisturization I have ever gotten from a product before, yet it somehow absorbs so quickly and is so lightweight. It's not oily at all and my skin feels so bouncy and plump after I use it. It doesn't ball up or pill on the skin, which is one of my biggest pet peeves in moisturizers, which is amazing and means it provides an incredible base for any makeup you apply on top. It definitely has a scent but I don't find it overpowering at all, and to be honest the smell alone is so amazing that it's the highlight of my skincare routine. My only issue with this product is the packaging; I would much prefer if it came in a jar like the Ceramidin Gel Cream or the Ceramidin Oil balm, or even if it came in a squeeze tube like it's available in as a sample. The packaging is frustrating but the product is so incredible that I have no issue putting up with it. I have a $400 face cream that I never even touch if I have this product to use instead. Do yourself a favour and give this a try!",1
"I have really dry skin; naturally winter months are rough and this cream saved my life. I mean, it smoothed out my eyes, and they were in bad shape. My face felt smoother and so hydrated. I've already purchased this three times and will continue to do so every time.",1
"This will get you through the winter or super dry days. It's thick and heavy, but I have pretty sensitive skin and this doesn't break me out. Now that it's warmer I use it locally and occasionally when my face is dyer than usual. I wear minimal makeup but it's decent under concealer for example around the nose and mouth area where I get some redness.",1
"I have extremely acne prone skin. Some moisturizers break me out. Others can leave me very greasy or not hydrating my dry patches at all. This moisturizer is AMAZING for combination skin. It completely cured my dryness without feeling too heavy. It does not make me look greasy and it controls my oils. Trust me, I have ridiculously oily skin. This is almost mattifying which makes it perfect as a makeup primer too. Even though it's a slightly thicker formula, it does not break me out at all. A little goes a long way as it spreads out thinly. I have rosacea and it soothes my redness. I find that I wake up with a more even skintone. This honestly has to be my holy grail moisturizer and does everything I could ask for. I'm impressed at this brand and Korean skincare. It is pricey, but totally worth it!",1
"My skin is dry and sensitive, and winter weather makes it worse. I've been using this cream for the past 3 months, and its a fantastic moisturizer that doesn't irritate or break out my skin. It feels like it might be heavy at first, but absorbs really nicely into the skin. Slightly odd smell, but its not a bad or strong odor and it dissipates quickly as you spread the cream. I probably will only use it occassionly in the summer while it's humid out, but it will definitely be a must have in my winter skin survival kit. On a separate note - the packaging is awful! The tube doesn't squeeze well, and as you manipulate it to get the cream out the outer coating cracks and chips and gets stuck on your hands with the cream! I got around this issue with my second tube by squeezing the whole tube into a glass jar for storage - but Dr Jart needs to fix this as I shouldn't need to re-package the product each time I buy it!",1
I bought this because the acne medicine my dermatologist prescribed me dried my usually normal face out. It doesn't feel like it really does anything. I still have dry patches and for almost $50 I was expecting more. It also has a really strong smell which gave me headaches.,0
"I used too many chemical exfoliants and needless to say - my skin was not happy with me. It was inflamed, red and flakey all over. I bought this product looking for something with ceramides and my skin was transformed overnight. So moisturizing but not heavy or sticky. Highly recommend!",1
"I only need one hand to count how many reviews I've ever written-so I think that alone says a lot. I was having some sort of allergic reaction/eczema flare up on my face, that for about a week, was not budging. I googled eczema remedies and this product came up. I purchased it and literally over night my skin was 50% better, and is continuing to heal from whatever that was. I will totally purchase again! My skin is so grateful for it!",1
"I use in combination with the liquid like many of the reviewers do. I love the texture of this cream, very hydrating, it spreads out easily and doesn't leave my face feeling oily and heavy. The only thing I dislike is the packaging, the paint rubs off by normal handling, it's so annoying!",1
"I got a sample of this from a Sephora employee who recommended it for my Dry/normal sensitive skin & let me tell you, it's amazing. My skin feels hydrated, supple, & just overall great! What a great find, & honestly a tube of this doesn't break the bank. Also a LITTLE goes such a long way! It spreads sooo well.",1
"This moisturizer kept the dry skin away for sure and I really did like it! But.... I got a lot of little forehead bumps after using this product and the tube it comes in is the worst! it lasted me about 3 months and by the end, it was torture trying to get the remains out of the tube! A lot of the product is wasted because you can't get it out and the paint on the side of the bottle chips off and gets everywhere! For me, not worth the price tag for such a SMALL amount",1
I went camping and got sunburned pretty bad. My face was peeling and so dry and itchy so I went into Sephora and the employee recommended this cream to me so I purchased it. With one application my skin was already feeling so much better. After 2 applications most of the redness and flaky skin was gone. I just applied this morning and my skin is looking and feeling great. I highly recommend this product.,1
I struggled with a oily forehead for years. The worst part was that not only was my forehead an oily slick mess but I had flaky skin in that area. It was as if my skin was dry yet oily... I knew that oily skin is often due to dehydrated skin so I tried many many products--from drug store brands to higher end brands such as Chanel and nothing really cured it. I also invested in a Clarisonic and several chemical exfoliant over the years and nothing fixed it. I finally bought the Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream and my problem is gone!! It took me months to realize I'd stopped needing to use blotting papers and that I no longer had to avoid applying makeup to my forehead for fear of making the flakes on my forehead more visible but in the end I realized it was this cream that changed everything!,1
"As a skincare junkie and exercise enthusiast, I've tried a lot of face lotions from Sephora in search of something to soothe my skin after frequent sweating and washing. I've tried Renewed Hope in a Jar, Argan Oil, Ultra Repair, Dramatically Different, Aqua Bomb, you name it, but this one came out on top. It's simple and calming to sensitive skin, absorbs quickly, and is the only cream I have tried that is intensely moisturizing without causing breakouts. It's a bit of a splurge, but a little goes a long way. And it smells nice :)",1
"I usually never write reviews but I love this product so much. I've had so skin issues recently due do a reaction to some other products. I was on steroids and creams to fix the initial reaction but my skin has been really dry and problematic since. I got a sample of this cream while at Sephora and didn't try it right away because it's thicker and I was concerned about breakouts (also an issue since my reaction). I was traveling and the first night my skin was so dry I remembered I had this sample in my bag. So I put it on and my skin was instantly better, it was unreal! It was soft and moisturized and just felt healed. I was stunned. I literally google Sephora right there from my hotel and it was my first stop the next morning to buy the full tube. It's one of my best purchases to date! It truly heals and makes your skin so soft and moisturized. I've had zero issues with clogging or breakouts. I can't say enough great things about this product.",1
"I have extremely dry, dehydrated, sensitive and redness prone skin. I've heard of this but was wary due to the price tag. However, this is actually worth it! My skin drinks this up and the lasting results are incredible.",1
This is the only cream i can use. i have extremely dry skin and i'm only 17 years old so i needed something that won't irritate my skin and will be light weight. i have the sun screen that goes with this. it it truly amazing. i would recommend 1000/1000,1
"I am an Esthetician, I understand how skin functions and how to implement complimentary skin care pretty well, have been doing it professionally for over 7 years. Cradle cap is caused because a baby's skin is so thin and the lipid barrier is fragile so skin sheds as it dries out rapidly, so I knew I had to add some protective lipids to gently reinforce his skins barrier. I had bought the intro kit w the serum and cream and liked it, would use it occasionally at night, mixed the serum in my regular skin care regimen, love the smell, but didn't get into it exclusively. When I started to look thru my vast collection of skincare products to treat my newborn sons cradle cap and baby acne (it was ALL OVER his poor little face, ears, neck and hairline) this worked in 8-12 hours and has kept it clear for 5 days now! I just bought the regular sized cream to keep him looking so handsome until it clears up naturally. I'm very impressed and will be evaluating how I can work this into my own skin care routine.",1
I have eczema and this didnt irritate my skin. After applying it the product doesn't completely get absorb but for the price i can purchase two jars of cetaphil which is great for my sensitive skin,1
This is one of the best creams i have used. it helps my over sensitive face. Calms the skin when i flare up.,1
"If you have eczema problems above your upper lip like i do, this stuff is amazing! It hydrates yet sinks in quickly so makeup can be applied on top of it. If you have oily skin i don't recommend using this all over your face, a little goes a long way!",1
"I've always used a serum and moisturizer in the am and pm, but for about a month nothing was really deeply moisturizing the dry parches on my cheek. With the winter in full swing, the parches grew bigger. I tried everything! Shea butter, aquafor, first aid beauty, hydration masks, and nothing. A beauty blogger was raving about this and decided to give it a try. I got it on Monday and the dry patches feel dramatically smaller. My skin feels moisturized and it's only day 3 of using this. I thought maybe it would be too good to be true and that later in the day my dry patches would come back. But they didn't!!! I used the liquid and cream and my face felt moisturized all day!!",1
Use it every morning. It is great for a dry face.,1
"I didn't think it was possible, but this has the thickness of a night cream, but adorbs really nicely and isn't greasy, making it perfect for daytime. My skin gets uncomfortably right when it's not well moisturized, and even after 14 hours, my face felt like I just applied this cream. So happy!",1
"I use this as a night cream, as its a nice thick moisturizer. I absolutely love it! Every morning when I wake up my skin feels fresh and hydrated. It has made a huge difference in my skin's texture as well. This is my new fave!",1
"I have ventured in my 30's with some problematic skin. I've always had dry skin, but in the past year I've developed an oily t-zone. Moisturizers either didn't do anything for my dry skin or it would make my skin oily. This cream along with the liquid makes my skin feel soft and smooth ALL DAY. It's a great base for makeup and if you have super dry skin this will be amazing for you. So glad I finally tried this.",1
"Does it's job!! Non greasy, moisturizing and smooth!",1
"Finally caught the cold/flu going around my office. Constantly blowing my nose has made my already dry skin even more sensitive and chapped around my nose and above my lips. TMI? Most of the creams I have tried cause my skin to sting or burn in this already sensitive area. So I started using this cream. It has soothed and healed my skin within a couple of days. I am still sick but have to say my skin doesn't show it. My skin may not feel hydrated throughout the entire day, but it no longer looks red, chapped or inflamed. I can comfortably wear foundation during the day to the office. I have since started using this cream on my entire face and it has definitely helped prevent dry flaky winter skin. Will definitely re-purchase.",1
"The first time I used it, my skin broke out. I am not sure if this caused it, but this was the only thing I changed from my skincare. After my skin calmed after few days, I used it again. I made sure that the cream was absorbed completely to reduce the breakout.",1
This is the most moisturizing cream I've ever used. After trying a sample I bought the full size because I loved it so much.,1
"I received a sample of this, and I am impressed! I have abnormally dry skin and this moisturizer really helped. My skin feels very soft now. Also, it evened my skin tone and removed a lot of its redness. Will be purchasing the actual moisturizer soon!",1
"Dr Jarts Ceramidin line of products are what I have been searching for...I live in an area of the country that has a very harsh Winter climate and I always have dry patches that peek out through my makeup no matter what I use. Until now....the first thing i use is a cleansing exfoliator, then Dr Jart serum and then the Cerimidin cream. My Makeup goes on so smoothly and flawlessly that I almost can't wait to wash my face and start again the next day. I am ADDICTED to this stuff. If you have DRY skin you have to try this product.",1
"I got this as a deluxe sample in a Dr Jart+ kit and was a tad skeptical of it. First time I used it, I realized that I might be a lifetime convert. I hate creams that feel greasy so I usually go oil-free, but those tend to not give me enough moisture in certain area. Meanwhile, my skin is acne-prone related to hormones, so I try to give it nothing extra that might irritate it. This cream is ideally moisturizing without being heavy, and so far hasn't broken me out once, and I actually feel like it's improved the look and texture of my skin. It's also a beautiful moisture base before I do my makeup. Even though it's a tad pricey (never spent this much on a moisturizer before), the tube is actually quite big. As for the packaging complaints, it comes with a small metal tube-wringer that helps you to get the the product out without too much waste.",1
"This is my go to moisturizer for any time if the day. I have combo skin, so if I use it durning the day I focus it more on my dry parts, but at night I lather this on and it helps plump my skin and the next morning I don't have any flakiness or any excess oil.",1
I had a sample of this that I was able to use about 10-15 times. I reached for it when my skin felt a bit dryer. As winter rolled around I decided to get the full size. But I'm almost done with the tube and I won't be repurchasing. This didn't really do a good job of keeping my skin moisturized and has led to some breakouts in the past couple of weeks. Another disappointing thing is the outside of the tube is peeling off sort of like chipping paint. I'm surprised a brand like this would have this design flaw. Disappointed it didn't work for me in the long run but it sounds like it works for a lot of other people!,0
"I do read lots of reviews before I brought this. It's good but so many people said it's perfect so I have a high expectation, when I tried by myself, it's absorbs quickly, but I cannot feel that much moisturize my face. It's really smooth after you apply the cream, and it's more good for combination skin I guess. But still a good product, I used not that much amount and it can apply all over my face. I usually mixed with serum.",1
This product is amazing. I love how it makes my skin feel.,1
"I wrecked my skin with a foundation that dried me out and then I exfoliated and my skin was raw and painful. I put on my normal skin care and my face was stinging so badly I ended up taking all of it off and slathering this cream on my face. And it was so incredible, it soothed and moisturized my poor face. It is kind of sticky initially but that goes away quickly and it sinks into the face and feels really smooth. I put it all over my face when it is really dry but I also use it when I just have a dry patch. I can even put it on my lips.Anyone that gets dry or dehydrated, I suggest you keep a tube of this in your cupboard at all times.",1
"I love this cream. It's thick, but not too thick, very moisturizing. I also like the slight medicinal herbal scent. However, I hate the packaging! The tube is metal and hard to ring out the product, even when there is plenty left. Furthermore, the paint chips off the label and gets onto my face and vanity. I will not be repurchasing, despite my love for the product. The packaging truly ruined it for me. I first tried this as a 100 point perk and the packaging was fine there, that will be the only time Ii'll try it again in future. Very disappointing.",0
I loved this. I have dry skin and this moisturizers my skin so well. I bought a holiday set with the liquid version and this together and they definitely gave my thirsty skin a drink. Only need to use the smallest amount because it goes such a long way. I will purchase the full size when mine runs out.,1
"This stuff is out of this world. I instantly notice healthier looking, plump and glowing skin when I use this day and night. My skin has never looked better. I never repurchase skincare products, because things usually don't wow me, but I squeezed every last bit of product out of my tube before rephrasing another. The ONLY THING I'm iffy on is the packing. Because it's a painted metal tube, the paint will start to flake off once you start running out of product and bending the tube. But this product is worth that little bit of annoyance. I'll still continue to use this, but I do hope they update the packaging!",1
"I had heard that this was good, but I didn't expect it to be this good. It makes my skin soft for days. Way worth the price. The only thing is that when I put it on my chin or the creases on my nose I can break out. But the pros easily outweigh the cons.",1
"I'm very skeptical of heavy moisturizers since I break out very easily, but this one has never made me break out which is perfect since my skin dries out terribly in the winter. It can leave an oily residue so use a VERY small amount or it's impossible to put makeup over it.",1
I have used this cream for a few months. I have dry skin and this did feel good going on. It did moisturize well although I needed more anti aging then this cream offers. If I was younger this would be a better choice for me. I was underwhelmed.,1
I grab this all year round - my combination skin loves it,1
"I love, love, love this moisturizer. If you have dry skin it is truly amazing what this does for your skin. It really feels like my skin drinks in this moisturizer and I just can't resist touching my face after applying it, it's just so soft!",1
I have tried so many moisturizers and oils to curb the peeling/flaking skin around my nose and mouth in the winter. This is it. Leave it on overnight and you'll wake up glowing. Put it on under makeup and it won't make makeup melt or wear off leaving dry patches. I'm in love.,1
LOVE LOVE LOVE I've tried drugstore and high end moisturizers this one by far is the best!! It doesn't break me out or feel greasy works well with my oils. I have combo oily skin but around my mouth in the winter very dry. With this moisturizer I don't have to reply throughout the day or worry about flaky skin.,1
"Dr Jart is the most amazing skincare line, other than Sunday Riley. This moisturizer has saved my life. I have extremely dry skin, especially during the winter months. I've tried a ton of moisturizers, but nothing compares. I honestly have yet to find a Dr. Jart product that I don't love! If you struggle with dry flaky skin, get this and thank me later",1
Amazing. Leaves an amazing finish and texture. I would recommend to a friend.,1
"I am allergic to most products and suffer from really dry and sensitive skin. This moisturizer is the best thing I've ever tried. It's incredibly hydrating and just after a few days of use my skin was clearer and softer. The only thing I would change about this product is the container. The metal tube cracks an the paint code often chips and gets on your fingers. Other than that, this is an excellent product",1
"The best moisturizer I have found for my dry, easily irritated skin. It takes a moment to settle in and can feel the slightest bit oily to the touch, but it has not caused any breakouts where other moisturizers do. I use a pretty intense facewash (Dr.Bronner's Peppermint Soap) and follow immediately with this. I searched so long to find something that felt creamy and good on my skin without breaking me out or screwing with my foundation. It honestly feels as though it has improved the texture of my skin with use. I can't recommend it enough.",1
"For those who love to play with their actives and high-powered acids, this is your godsend. I first tried this as a 100 point sample from Sephora but I have now purchased a full size and never looked back. It is on the more expensive side but, in my mind, totally worth it. ",1
"This is by far the best face moisturizer I have used. I've been using for about a year ever since a sales associate gave me a sample In store. I've never had any negative reaction to it. No strong smell and absorbs great into skin. I am finally at the end of my tube and like other reviewers have said, the only negative is that the packaging flakes onto your hands. It comes with a metal bar that's supposed to be used to push the product out but it makes the flaking worse. I can't take a star off for that though because the actual product and formula is amazing.",1
"I had a sample of this from a previous order and immediately bought the full size when I ran out. I tend to have dehydrated skin all year round but it gets very dry during the winter months. This has save my skin. I was dry and flaky around my nose and hair line and this fixed it after only a few uses. If you need a major moisture boost for your skin, definitely give this a try. A little goes a long way so be careful not to over-do it. I also love the you get a little tube-squeezer to get every last bit out, great little bonus.",1
"I have been using this product almost a year now and it has been my miracle product. I suffer from dry, sensitive skin that is prone to break outs, redness, and irritation. It took years of products- both beauty brands and prescription- and this cream is the only product I have ever tried that consistently gives me good results- it's my daily go-to. It doesn't burn on application, quickly absorbs, and leaves a nice fresh feel. If you have sensitive skin, I'd definitely try this product out!",1
"I've had such a problem with dry skin this winter, and this has saved me. I have mild acne in my t zone and chin; this does not upset it. Love how soft my skin feels! A little goes a long way too",1
Love the product but not a big fan of the packaging. The packaging looks nice but the white and yellow parts peel off by time. Hope you guys can improve it.,1
"I would love to share this with everyone that ceramidin is the best moisturizer,because it moisturizers , it heals , it seals the moisture factor of skin, it makes your foundation look even better , it will bring out with the best days of your skin, looking more smooth and plumped. It's a pricey product but worth every single penny. I always read reviews and then on believing in the reviewer's belief I buy products, honestly today u believe me and spend almost 50$ for your most precious skin.",1
"I love this cream. It is the best moisturizer I have used, so I will continue to purchase it. The cream is 5 stars and I highly recommend it. I took a star off because of the metal tube it is in. When the tube gets low, it is difficult to get the product out because the metal is not very pliable. On top of that the paint (if that's what it is) flakes off and it gets into the lotion and onto my face as I apply the lotion. Please change this Dr. Jart!",1
"I never write reviews but feel the need to for this product. I suffer from dry skin/redness and live in Winnipeg, Canada and our winters are extremely dry and cold, so not very helpful for my skin. I've tried countless skincare moisturizers to help me with dryness and this is the ONLY product that not only keeps me moisturized all.day.long (something i never thought would be possible for me) but has taken away my redness!! I hardly wear foundation now and I have been told by several friends that I look tan and I have fair skin. I am so devoted to this product. PS. A little goes a long way!!! I can get away with a pea size amount for my whole face.",1
"I love this product. It is lightweight, but provides great, long-lasting moisture. But man, the tube's paint (the actual color and lettering) flakes off and gets EVERYWHERE. They need to change this because it is beyond annoying.",1
"I received a small sample and instantly loved it. The tiny tube lasted a fair amount of time, and I've since bought the full sized tube. This stuff is the last layer in my routine and my skin is so supple! I absolutely love it.",1
I have very very very dry skin. Around my forehead and nose especially I am very dry and I can be flakey and gross. My family and I recently moved from the northeast to Wisconsin and my skin has suffered. The cold and the wind had taken its toll. I have been using this cream for about 2 months and it makes my skin so hydrated. I have tried so many different things and I was not going to be pleased if I spent almost $50 for another dud but this is amazing. Will repurchase. When I bought this I also purchased the sleep mask by the same brand in the blue bottle. Awesome as well. This cream has me right with the Lord.,1
"I am in love with this cream. I've been using for more than two months now and love everything about it. I layer under the Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Liquid and have learned that a little goes a long way. I use a pea-sized amount out less and pat (not rub) over my face. I have also been using this for under eye-cream, after I apply to my face I use another pea-sized amount to dab around my eyes for added moisture. I am lucky to have only a few very fine lines under my eyes, but this product really moisturizes and plumps the skin to make those lines disappear. Some people have complained about the scent, but I love it! To me is smells like a high-end spa.",1
this cream works by natually healing the skin barrier. It worked better than repair creams and other foreign brands to me without breaking out skins.,1
"I am an oily, acne prone, sensitive skin gal. Finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out is incredibly difficult and frustrating, let alone one that doesn't make me feel greasy. I was originally looking at Tiger Grass Cream instead to help with my acne. However, after much consideration, I finally chose this one instead. I am very glad that I did.",1
"I've been on the search for a moisturizer to go along with my skin care routine. I use prescription topical creams for my acne morning and night. All the moisturizers I have tried never gave me enough hydration or don't work well with the topical creams. I went to Sephora and picked this one up and it is gold! I don't flake and it's so hydrating that my skin doesn't feel tight. I will say it does leave a luminous finish on my skin but I don't mind it. It has also helped with my acne and healing my skin. Because I use prescription acne creams they can be pretty harsh on the skin, but this moisturizer really helps to balance everything out and like it claims, it really helps strength the skins barrier. Definitely a favorite and I will purchase again!",1
"I have used this for over a year. When I try other products, my skin doesn't look and feel as dewy. I use this with the serum. Together they leave my skin soft and more plump than it is without them.",1
"I loved the effects of this moisturizer, especially with my super dry winter skin - but I can't deal with the overpowering medicinal scent. For this reason, I much prefer the Dr Jart Ceramidin liquid, which is zero scent, followed by a different moisturizer. I don't know why they would include such a bizarre (and personally, malodorous) scent if it's not strictly necessary. Recommended if you like/don't care about fragrances, but try the liquid treatment if the smell bothers you!",1
"My skin was dehydrated and dry from chilly weather. I started using this with the liquid (which is a serum) and I saw results almost immediately. I use this combo at night with a facial oil and I wake up with baby soft, plump skin. Couldn't be more pleased. I have sensitive skin and this is soothing. In fact, my redness has disappeared! This is my holy grail moisturizer!",1
"Best moisturizer, been using for 2 years now. Best for dry skin esp in winter.",1
"I bought this cream along with the Ceramidin Liquid for my dehydrated skin, and I'm SO glad that I did. After~ a month of consistent use, my face is no longer constantly dry and tight, and feels normal again. I still use it daily because I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin while being extremely hydrating. I just ordered my second tube to use as an everyday moisturizer. I just wish there was an SPF version.",1
Liked this cream a lot but think it works best when using the lotion first. I plan to always use the two together.,1
"I got this as a deluxe sample and have used it while traveling on multiple flights. It is very moisturizing but did not cause breakouts. I also find it intensely healing to use after an at-home chemical peel. Will be purchasing the full size when I run out (a little goes a surprisingly long way), mostly for when I need heavy duty TLC. There is a slight medicinal smell, though I thought it was weaker than the scent of the mask in this product line, and it fades quickly. The texture is thicker than the gel version, but spreads easily. My face soaks up both versions. I haven't tested it as a primer, but it did not leave my face shiny. Overall, very good product for anyone with dry skin.",1
I've been using this for about a year now. In Minnesota winters my skin gets so dry. This is the only thing that helps keep my skin moisturized. For my detailed review see below.,1
"I really like this and use it on my face only. I have dry sensitive cream and lather my body and face with lots of moisturizer. This is wonderful as a part of my skin hydration routine. The only issue is I do not use that much product (dime+ size) for face and neck, and I am blowing through this tube fast. I do like the metal thing they give you to roll the tube to get every bit of product out of the container as at this price, you need it. I will be looking for a ceramic alternative as it is really high priced for what you get. I think I can find another face product for me less. If money is not a concert - go for it you will probably really like it",1
"This is so drying! I put it on at night and woke up with dry, tight skin. I put it on again this morning and I can barely move my face because my skin feels so tight. Not for people with very dry skin!!!!!",0
"This product is really good, not the best, but really good. Unfortunately there is not enough product for the amount of money paid.",1
"I have been used this cream every day and night for 1and half months, and feel the actual improvement. normally, i do not want waste time to write a review, but for this cream I feels that if i do not give it a five start review with description, I feel sorry about myself. this cream is the first cream that i ever used can maintain the ceramidin ingredients still effective but without a really oil base. it is indeed oil and cream, but it is not oilly. so it can absorb by your skin really quick and the result is amazing. you can actually feel your skin be more softer and smooth after you wash your face. it is the feeling we touch a baby face. so you can image how nice it is. and indeed the ceramidin really helps to rebuild the ability of skin's own function of protection. especially, useful to the people who wash their face every day by really warm water.",1
"I have tried so so many moisturizers, ranging from drug store brands to high end. This moisturizer has been a life changer for me. I have combo/dry skin. Even with an oily t-zone my cheeks get so dry and I get patchy. This moisturizer has made my face look so much better and has helped me even out my skin tone and correct the dryness. It's great to use under makeup.",1
"I have dry sensitive skin, and am very picky about what products I use on my skin, especially my face. I often buy a regular cream and add my own oils, hyaluronic acid, etc.",1
"I've always had issues with day creams because I have very dry skin. With the creams I've used in the past, by the end of the day, my skin felt tight and even dirty. BUTTTT this skincare specialist at Sephora introduced me to this cream - and I am officially a convert. I love how it goes on and my skin still feels soft throughout the day. The only thing is that it smells a little medicine-y? Other than that, it's a fabulous cream. Definitely recommend!",1
"This is hands down the best moisturizer I've ever used! I pair this with the liquid as well since I'm so dry and it makes my foundation lay perfectly! If you're not sure about the splurge, get a sample at Sephora or get the ""help me"" kit they offer for $36 with the cream and liquid! You will not be disappointed!",1
"I'm on my second tube - the first one lasted practically a year! Best, best, best moisturizer, especially for winter. My skin loves it. Oh, and it completely agrees with my super-sensitive skin! Love.",1
"Just one dab of this product gives so much hydration to the skin. I really love using it at night after cleansing my face to reopen USB hydration. Definitely has become a new favorite nightly moisturizer for my acne-prone, dry skin. I actually really like the smell of the Ceramidin line and how they all smell similar to one another.",1
"It does everything a moisturizer should. Its hydrating, it gives your skin a soft, supple, almost juicy appearance (not shin-juicy as in plump). It makes my skin look airbrushed!",1
"I have extremely dry skin. And, by extreme, I mean that I've yet to meet a person who's skin flakes faster than mine. I'd been using Perricone MD for almost a year but I was still having dryness problems. Since switching to Dr. Jart+'s Ceramidin Cream, I haven't had any dryness problems! It's only a been a month so time will tell if it continues but, so far, I'm happy.",1
A beauty blogger suggested this during the vib sale so I put it on my list. It immediately worked wonders on my dry face!!! My face never been so smooth even make up is applying 100x better!!!,1
"Love this moisturizer! Hydrates wonderfully without leaving an oily film, and a tiny bit goes a long way! Good for sensitive, dry skin that can get oily, doesn't cause breakouts.",1
"I have THE most sensitive skin including rosacea. I live in LA, so the sun is brutal along with the extremely dry desert air - my skin was a complete disaster when I moved here. I use tried and true Cetaphil as my face wash, spritz rose water on my face afterwards, and apply this cream before bed (I pat it in until it's fully absorbed). My skin is so incredibly soothed after. Zero breakouts or rosacea issues since. Highly recommended.",1
"Not for everyone, but for me, a lifesaver. I have used creams from $15 - $200. Although I liked the $200 creams, that isn't in my budget. This cream is creamy, thick, moisturizing, and yet absorbs quickly. I love the mild scent. I use a retin-a product for rosacea and this really helps to balance the dryness. Try before you buy.",1
"I love this cream and will buy again. It has a lovely texture and a noticeable floral (roses to my nose) scent that fades. I have really oily skin that is also somehow dry underneath the surface, and prone to flare ups with some formulations. This cream moisturizes under my skin's surface instead of sitting on top of my skin and making it look even more greasy. My skin looks and feels softer, especially the skin under my eyes. I wore this under my makeup for my wedding photos and my skin looked amazing! I look forward to trying other products in the line.",1
So moisturizing a little goes a long way Works better paired with the liquid,1
"Disliked this product. Did not like the smell, and made my skin very oily",0
"I have been searching for my HG moisturizer for as long as I can remember and I can finally stop searching. I have fair, sensitive, combination yet acne prone skin that is dehydrated but not dry and this stuff hits all my needs in a simple tube. It's hydrating but not greasy, thick but dries to a light finish and the smell is heavenly. I am a fan for life and just stocked up with the VIB rouge sale!!!",1
Another reviewer suggested trying it first and I agree; it may not be for everyone but it's perfect for my combination skin,1
"This cream when used with the ceramidin liquid works incredibly well. I absolutely love the calming scent, and the texture of this cream. I moved to Las Vegas from Miami and the difference it has made to my skin is incredible. I could not find a lotion that could moisturize my skin well enough to prevent dry patches, etc. One week of using this product and I can already feel a dramatic difference in my skins texture. Will be purchasing this product again and again.",1
"I think this product is really effective for some, because I've heard great reviews in the past. But it didn't work for me. The smell was very strong, and after using it I broke out really bad. That said it could just be me, or something in the product my skin didn't like. Before spending the big bucks though, try a sample!",0
"If you have oily and sensitive skin like me, this is the moisturizer for you. My skin not only feels hydrated, but when I use this on top of topical acne medication, it also feels like it helps the healing process. I mix this in with the Kevyn Aucoin Sensual Skin Enhancer during the the day and it wears amazingly as a foundation.",1
"I have dry, dehydrated skin with a bit of an oily T-Zone and this moisturizer is the only one I've found that is moisturizing enough without making me greasy. It also has a calming scent that I absolutely love.",1
I burned my skin at the stadium. Always took care of my skin so I was really concerned about the damage. This cream was a blessing. Skin is Dewey and plump. Ill be a fan forever.,1
"I'm about to buy my third tube of this cream (and they've each lasted quite a long time for use both morning and night) so figured I should leave a review. Simply put, no other moisturizer has ever been everything I need it to be. This is the one. It is enough moisturizer for me in cold NY winters and not too heavy for humid summers. I use this with the ceramidin liquid (I also use the ceramidin body oil, the sleeping mask, the gold BB cream, the milk peel and the sheet masks). I've suffered with seborrheic dermatitis on the sides of my nose and while the FAB anti redness serum has basically cured my flare ups this cream seems to keep my skin in check. I absolutely love it.",1
This is my favorite moisturizer. It absorbs quickly & makes dry skin disappear over night!,1
"This is the first time my skin has been this soft. I read reviews from people with sensitive skin and decided to try it. Noticed immediate difference, and when i went to my eyebrow lady she said ""wow your face is so soft! What are you using"", when i went to sephora for a makeover the beauty rep was blown away too. I have never been complimented on my face skin condition, my skin is either too dry or red or too oily. This stuff is a miracle for me.",1
"I got the sample of this as one of my free samples when I placed an order one time, and I fell in love. I eventually bought the full size and I know it's going to last me a very very long time. I have combo skin and this works just perfectly with my LUSH Cosmetics cleansers.",1
Love it!!! I can see the difference in my skin after first use!!! Makeup went on better than before too~! Now my husband is also using it after he tried the sample we got a month ago when we went on a trip-.-,1
It really improved my skin's moisture barrier and improve my skin overall. It's not super heavy either and I like the scent.,1
"I am now on my second of two of the Sephora 100 point perk deluxe samples of this face cream which were available a while ago. Once I started using the fist sample I knew I needed to get more, but after seeing the $48 price tag on the full size I decided to opt for a second sample. The samples have lasted me a very long time so I can't even imagine how long this big tube will last me when I eventually cave and buy it! I even cut open my first tube to make sure I got every last drop. You don't need a lot of this stuff, but it's worked wonders on my skin. I use it after I shower and before I go to bed and when I wake up I have moisturized, firm, even toned skin. I have combo skin, with both oily and dry patches between my eyebrows, on the sides of my nose, and on my chin but this stuff takes care of both issues. I'm obsessed!! It has a slight citrusy-type smell but it goes away once the product is fully rubbed in. Love it!!!",1
"This stuff is saving my skin. For the first time in years my combination/extremely acne prone skin which is always flaking and dry as it heals, is soft and moisturized and wonderful. This stuff isn't greasy, you only need a tiny bit, and it lasts forever.",1
I tried this because my skin was so dry and dehydrated. I certainly think that this has helped in the recovery of my skin. I like the fact that there is a metal applicator so that the chances of getting bacteria in the product is reduced.,1
"I have combination skin and this cream is amazing. Perfect amount of moisture - I use it every morning and night. However, the packaging is horrid. It is painted over metal so the paint flakes all over, including onto your hands before you apply the product you're trying to get out. Also, the metal breaks when you try to fold it over so product is exposed to air. It's obnoxious enough to begin looking for a new moisturizer.",1
"I tried this on my very sensitive skin when looking for a moisturizer. Sorry to say the smell overpowered me (I kept getting some weird fish smell) and I just couldn't use it (made it to day three). Cannot comment on how it works but it is very thick, heavy, and creamy.",0
"Soothes and moisturizers my dry skin--a little goes a long way. I prefer my face products unscented, but this isn't offensive.",1
"First, I must explain how hard it is for me to find a good moisturizer that actually moisturize my inner dry sensitive oily skin. Most of any moisturizers make me break out so its a big gamble for me to try new products. I got it originally as a sample from Sephora. Since I have a sensitive skin with tendency to bad break out from some cosmetic products, I first tried it on my hands. I put them on the back of my hands before bed and I was brown away by how smooth and soft my hands were next morning. Truly, I have never experienced anything with such a dramatic result over night. My hands were visibly smoother, softer and really 10 years younger looking. So I tried on my face too. Well, the out come was to as magical as on my hands, but my sensitive skin did not break out and was very soft and moisturized. The beige color thick cream has somewhat unique herbal kind of smell but I personally think it's not a problem. Little goes a long way so even the small sample tube lasted me a whole week. I like to mix this with my other gel type moisturizer for added boost of moisture for my face and use the cream alone for my hands. I am so happy that I found this cream!!!",1
"I got this as a reward perk ( I actually got 4 :D ). I love it if you can't tell. It's really soothing on my dry skin. It has a scent, but it's again, a very soothing one, almost like eucalyptus or tea tree. I apply a little over a facial oil and my skin just soaks it right up. Make up also glides on beautifully over it. Will defiantly purchase the full size when all my samples run out.",1
"I got this as a sample with my rewards point. I really wanted to like it since I've been using Dr. Jart's sunscreen and it's worked well for me. However, I just didn't get the purpose of it. It felt too thick and oily on my face, but it didn't moisturize enough for my body/feet. I will not be buying the full-size.",0
"I started using this at the same time as the Ren glycol lactic radiance mask so I'm not sure which one is more responsible for the improvement I'm noticing in my skin, but I'm definitely going to keep using both! My skin is brighter & looks more plump. I've been using a pea sized amount at night and really like the way it melts into my skin, absorbs quickly with no greasy residue",1
"Received a sample of the Ceramidin Cream. Pros: It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well. No smell, no irritation. Works great at night as a moisturizer over medicated rosacea cream. Cons: Doesn't play well with makeup. I tried to use it in the a.m. as a moisturizing base for makeup. Mistake! Makeup didn't blend well over it and just streaked. Had to wipe it all off and start over.",1
"I had dry, red and sensitive skin and finally I have a product that suits me. I went into Sephora with complaints about my dry ruddy skin tone and came out with a new routine that includes an oil makeup remover, Dr. Jartt serum and ceremidin cream. I also bought the tarte sea foundation and altogether it has drastically improved my skin.",1
"Received as a sample and I wish I could buy the full size. It's a great product but I don't think it's worth the money. If you can afford it, then by all means, because it works wonderfully. I just can't justify the price tag.",1
Absolutely love this cream! I have combination acne prone skin and I invested so much time & money trying to find the perfect moisturizer that wouldn't break me out but still hydrating. This was recommended to me by a friend and I haven't used anything else ever since. Don't let the word cream intimidate you. It's super lightweight and absorbs quickly. A lot of moisturizes made for acne prone skin are drying and leaves your face feeling stiff and dry...this has been a godsend!,1
"I have extremely dry skin, not flaky, but face feels tight immediately after washing and need mid-day replenishment. I used this cream together with the Ceramidin Lotion, but this combination was not moisturizing enough for me unfortunately.",0
"I've always had a difficult time finding a moisturizer that kept my skin feeling good all through the day and night and not just when you first apply it. I finally found it. I originally got the mini and ended up purchasing the full size tube. I've also noticed diminishing scars, plumper skin, less oil, and overall softness. It seems to be great for my sensitive skin.",1
"Not only is my skin very dry, mature, and sensitive, it's also dehydrated. To add insult to injury, I live in a very dry climate with harsh winters. So, I'm always in search of skincare products that are gentle, yet effective at helping my skin hold onto what little moisture it has, while helping maintain the skin barrier integrity. A very tall order! I rely heavily on serums to hydrate my dehydrated skin and for their anti-aging properties, and facial oils to give my dry skin the moisture boost it needs, so my moisturizer is there to seal in all the benefits of the serums/oils, and maintain and protect my skin barrier. ",1
"I've struggle for years to find a moisturizer that didn't immediately break me out. Even if it said 'non-comeodogenic', the next day I'd be a disaster zone. When I was younger, I could get away with not moisturizing that frequently because my skin was super oily. As I've gotten older, it's dried out, but I still deal with acne on a daily basis. I started using tea tree oil which dried me out even more, but has made a noticeable impact on blemishes, but made a moisturizer necessary. I picked this up last weekend as a 100 point perk and have resisted writing a review until after the whole tube was gone. I can safely say that I love it! The smell is a little on the chemical side, but not unpleasant or overpowering. Absorbs quickly, doesn't leave my face like a grease slick, and has made my skin super soft. It's also help heal some blemishes. I will 100% be buying a full size ASAP.",1
"I keep ordering this as a 100 point perk. I like it. It's pretty pricey though. I like it mixed with a lighter moisturizer for nighttime. On its own it's really nice and makes my skin feel really soft, but I don't like the scent of it. I haven't noticed any reduction in redness using it. I have really fair skin and red cheeks, so even if it sort of worked I would notice quickly.",1
Amazing ingredient :) I will buy toner and body oil as well.,1
"I chose this sample size as a beauty reward, and glad I did! With just one use, my skin looks and feels more plump, smooth, and moisturized without any greasy feel. The scent is light, rose/herbal, which I like. Not a 5 star since I have only one use to go on, but I can say I really love it so far!",1
"I tend to break out every time I try it on, wanted it to work but it doesn't do it. I am just going to use it as a lotion for my body.",0
Great anti aging product!,1
"Makes me look younger, smooth's lines, Not sure why they don't mark it as anti aging because its better than anything I have ever used. The packaging looks like some fungi cream or something but I cant even take a star away from it. I don't notice any smell like the others commenters said.",1
"The highest praise I can give is it does NOT irritate my dry sensitive skin. Even though it clearly has fragrance (smells good imo) it does not irritate my skin at all or leave it red, and I have a problem with redness. In fact, using it with the matching serum I notice a decrease in my redness on my cheeks, so it has to be doing something right! Absorbs quick, light weight, and so hydrating. It really is great.",1
"I picked this up as a 100-point reward because I love another drugstore lotion that contains ceramides. This also has licorice which is very calming to the skin, and some other really good ingredients (maddeningly, the full ingredients are not shown here on Sephora, just selected ones). Unfortunately, Dr. Jart undoes all the good this cream can do by including strong fragrance! I see several fragrances listed below (roses, medicine) but to me it smelled like lavender. Many people have the impression lavender is helpful to skin, but actually dermatalogical research shows quite clearly it's irritating/damaging to the skin on a micro level. In fact, fragrances in general are one of the MOST irritating ingredients to include in skincare. If skincare was formulated properly, it would never contain fragrance. Anyway, I learned my lesson - open the tube and smell before picking up a reward! So this gets three stars because it could have been good, if they had just made it fragrance free!! I cannot use anything with fragrance on my face (I have rosacea), and especially not lavender (I immediately get red and sweaty) so I passed this along to a friend.",1
"I battle with super dry skin, but I think I may have found my go to moisturizer. This moisturizer feels so rich and creamy without being heavy or greasy. Absorbs quickly but leaves my skin feeling plump, smooth, and hydrated. Does not clog my pores. I have bought it 2 times now as a 100 pt reward, but now I am going to purchase a full size tube. I use this both morning (under my Murad Essentail-C spf 30) and evening as a night cream. My skin is so happy. I find the slightly earthy fragrance very pleasing. The real test will be this winter, but so far, I highly recommend.",1
The smell of this is so bad I couldn't wait to wash it off!!! Smells like menthal or medicine very strong!!,0
yuck- smells so strong of dead roses!!! yuck- had to wash off,0
"I spent almost a year looking for a rich but lightweight moisturizer to combat newly dry skin, and Ceramidin cream is the winner! A little goes a long way, it hydrates like crazy, and doesn't make me shiny. It smells great, too. A tube lasts me about a month (my BF may sneak some from time to time). Only complaint: I don't love the metal tube, but I can live with it!",1
"I originally tried this cream as one of the 100pt rewards (0.2oz), and I was absolutely blown away. I have dry skin that is very sensitive/reactive. If a product does not agree with me, I break out in hives (Origins Ginzing Moisturizer had this effect unfortunately). My skin loved this cream! It helped calm the redness I tend to get around my chin and nose. Makes your skin plump, absorbs quickly, and is incredibly lightweight, non-greasy. It also did not block my pores. It has a light botanical scent that dissipates within minutes. Definitely pick it up as a 100pt reward while you still can! I will be purchasing the full-size version once I run out of mine.",1
"I was using Bobbi Brown's Face Base which I sitll love. It does great under makeup, as does this. The only reason I prefer this one more is because when it's used alone, it doesn't leave me oily like the Bobbi Brown does. When I use the BB by itself, it seems to just sit on top of my skin and I look oily. This soaks into my skin beautifully and doesn't leave me oily looking. Makeup goes on great on top of it as well. I have sensitive/combo skin with an oily tzone and this cream is perfect for it.",1
"I have never been able to wear bb cream with my extremely dry skin but within a few days this cream transformed my skin and makeup looks flawless on my skin. It's been hard to find the perfect cream for my face because I have eczema, sensitive, and super dry skin but I have found the most magical cream that I will continue to repurchase.",1
"My skin is extremely dry and sensitive. I alternate between using a combo of Ceramidin Cream with Ceramidin Liquid, and Ceramidin Oil Balm with Ceramidin Liquid for the colder months. I have tried SO many creams, oils, serums - but this is the only thing that keeps my face moisturized throughout the day. Also it does not leave your skin with a sticky feeling. LOVE IT!",1
This cream is amazing it gives your skin an amazing glow to it it leaves it so soft... Love it,1
"I got a deluxe sample of this and really like it. It's very moisturizing and brightens the skin. I've used a lot of expensive creams and I didn't see any better results. I don't have lines or wrinkles so maybe that's why. I'll just stick to a good moisturizer for now. I love this and the Clinique dramatically different moisturizers. Maybe when I start seeing lines or wrinkles I'll revisit the expensive creams. For now, a moisturizer works wonders, and this is a great one. It works well with all my other face products as well. It doesn't make my glycolic gel ""curl"" up like most of the others I've tried. My foundation also glides on really well and it gives a good finish without giving a heavy feeling.",1
I have a love-hate relationship with Creme de la Mer. I love the product and hate the price. I discovered Ceramidin Cream over a year ago and have been using it to soothe my dry skin. I pair it with the Ceramidin liquid and have had fantastic results. ,1
"I use this every morning, it's lightweight and does not oil up my face. Works great keeping my skin moisturized. There are no issues wearing it under my make up.",1
i bought the trial pack and this was in it. i love it. i use it in my daily face moisturizing routine in the morning. im running out so i need to get more soon. haha,1
"I loved this at first because my face was so dry. I wore only this on my face and not only is this orange on my face, it stained my forehead.",0
"This is by far the best moisturizer that I have used in a long time! I have a combination skin with dry patches around lips. This cream is very emollient, but gets fully absorbed after a short while. Skin feels plump and fully moisturized, pores look smaller. I love the light botanical scent.",1
I use this at night to help my skin get the extra moisture it needs. After a month of using it my skin feels supple when I wake up and also throughout the day. I also use the Dr Jart moisture mask over it.,1
"I love any sort of skin care product.. so I am constantly testing out different moisturizers. However, I seem to keep coming back to this guy. Not too thick/creamy, but not too thin. Perfect texture to keep my face free of extra oil that can trigger acne for me.",1
"This is truly an amazing product. Completely worth it. I'm a man with combination skin with dry, flaky irritated patches around my nose, and after 1 month of using this, I honestly now have the best skin I've ever had. Virtually blemish free and...dewy. Seriously. I typically wouldn't review a product, but this is just so good that I had to. I use this over the Ceramidid Liquid daily and absolutely love it. I find the smell very invigorating and pleasant, too. I had been searching for a moisturizer that works for me for a while and I think I finally found it.",1
"I'm writing this review after finishing my entire tube. It took about about 3 months to finish, which is pretty short I feel. When I first squeeze it out of the tube, it is quite firm looking but when smoothed over my face it turns quite emollient and easy to spread out. It's has both watery moisturizing qualities as well as a bit of oilyness to hold in the moisture from leaving.",1
Broke out the next day!,0
"I've been using this moisturizer for over a year now. I can honestly say that my skin has never been so smooth and soft. I have combination skin and on any given day can be a grease pit and have dry flaky skin at the same time. This moisturizer had almost completely changed that. My favorite part is it doesn't seem to aggravate acne when I do have a break out. Summer or winter, day and night, this is one of the best moisturizers you can buy",1
I have pretty dry skin and have tried more moisturizers than I can count or list but this is the first one that makes my skin feel quenched. My face always felt tight after washing it and while a moisturizer helped to solve this right after the face wash it would be the same next day. This actually leaves my face moisturized days after. I recommend this to anyone with dry skin.,1
"This is a thick cream, but absorbs well. Keeps my skin moisturized without causing breakouts. I use it at night and for morning I use the lighter Dr Jart Water Drops moisturizer. No complaints whatsoever.",1
"I've been searching for a moisturizer that works wonders on my dry/dehydrated skin. It wasn't until recently that I did some research and discovered that any oily T-zone (that came with adult acne) I had was due to lack of moisture and hydration. Once I changed my skin care regimen from acne based (which further dried out my skin causing it to produce more oil) to one that treats dry/dehydrated skin, my face was drastically different. I use this after the Dr. Jart lotion/ serum (as recommended) and my face has never been clearer or more hydrated.",1
"I Can't say enough good things about the Dr. Jart ceramidin line. I tried it in a value set and was super impressed. Not only did it absorb quickly but it felt light and super moisturizing. Beyond that it tackled my fine lines and wrinkles like a pro! And as a bonus, it also helped with my sun spots!",1
"This is a moisturizer that I will re-purchase again and again. The texture is fairly thick, but it goes on easily and absorbs without leaving a greasy feel. It has a nice fragrance, not too strong and doesn't linger for long. I have reactionary skin and I had no issues with this product. In the winter months I would rub the excess on my hands after applying to face and neck and it really helped keep my hands from getting chapped, which usually happens to me whenever it's cold. I love this moisturizer.",1
"This product matches my skin perfectly! I have beige skin a bit on the fair side, especially not in the summer. When I put it on I was a bit nervous about how it would match my tone but it matches perfectly! It also has decent coverage, it evens out my redness and helps to hide my sunken under-eyes. Definitely happy about finding this product!",1
"I have the combination skinï¼Œdry on the cheek and a little bit oily around the nose. This moisturizer does a good job on hydrating the skin,it might feel thick at first but absorbing really quick. I definitely will repurchase it, the smell is also fresh.And for oily skin in summer, try its liquid lotion!",1
"This cream moisturizes my sensitive combination skin well without ever irritating it. The consistency is a little thicker than other moisturizers I've tried, but it goes on easily and is absorbed quickly. I've tried it over the (travel-sized) Ceramidin serum and will buy the full-size serum next. Love, love, love it!",1
"I was curious about 'K beauty' and needed a lighter, springtime moisturizer to replace my used up Caudalie Premier Cru, which is my winter moisturizer (and which I wish wasn't so expensive). This is a little lighter, of similar texture, and easily as moisturizing. My skin looks and feels great so I may use Ceramidin Cream year round now. We'll see - recommended!",1
"Tried this on a whim, very moisturizing, nice consistency.",1
"I really like this cream, it's my favorite so far out of everything I've tried. Doesn't clog my pores, is hydrating without feeling greasy, is a good prep for the skin before makeup also soothed and healed irritation caused by other products I tried",1
"Love, love, love this cream! It's a thicker, silkier cream that I love for every season. It really helps my skin retain moisture, which gives an appearance of younger looking skin! I use this in combo with the brightening Dr. Jart mask. I've gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since starting this regimen. Also, according to the Dr. Jart website, all of their products are safe for pregenant women. Finding a good and safe face lotion during pregnancy is hard, IMO! I had the hardest time finding a lotion that fit my needs during pregnancy that didn't suck or have a ton of contraband in it!",1
"I have very dry skin already, and recently began Renova (Retin A for wrinkles). This Dr. Jart's Ceramidin cream has eliminated the flaky skin that I am supposed to be getting by starting Renova. It also has made the small dry patches that I've battled for years a thing of the past. I love this cream. Scent is very light & disappears almost immediately. My skin is hydrated, smooth, cushioned, & radiant with this. I immediately had results, and they have continued to build. It is very rich, so you only need a little bit. It would also work well as something to dab on dry spots (for combo skin). Though concentrated, it soaks in & my skin is not greasy. Ceramides as a skin care ingredient are proven beneficial. I'm so happy I bought this; I went back and bought the Ceramidin liquid (which is great, too). Finally, my HG moisturizer!!!",1
"Keeps dry cheeks moist and makes oily t zone moisturized without making you look oily. I love this stuff so much that I bought the body oil, balm to oil, sun screen, micro foaming cleanser and even ceramidin hand cream all from dr. jart. This stuff smells like spa too. So lovely",1
Best moisturizer I have ever used for my dry flakey skin! â¤ï¸,1
"I have a combination skin and during fall and winter my skin gets quite dry from extremely cold outdoor weather in MI and blasting heat from indoor. I tried to mix a few drops of oil to cream to combat the dryness, and it seemed to work before I went to sleep. However the next day I still felt lack of moisture from within. I purchased this and what I love about it is that throughout the day, despite the extreme temperature differences and conditions that I went through, my skin did not feel dry! I could understand what ceramidin claimed that it will form a barrier, and it did. It's even more awesome if you use it in conjunction with ceramidin liquid! The only down side is that it's a bit pricey for me, but still during winter I have a feeling that I will repurchase this and the liquid! (My friend who has an extremely dry skin though, did say that this wasn't enough for her super dry skin.)",1
"I love this product so much, it has me singing cheesy love songs. Quick background: I have terribly oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I moved from a humid climate to a dry/cold/bipolar/what? climate, and my skin freaked out. On top of the regular oil-and-acne mess I have the misfortune of dealing with, my skin was peeling in places from dry patches. I tried a few ""skin sensitive"" moisturizers, but didn't feel as though they were actually moisturizing my skin. I happened upon Dr. Jart's Cermidin Cream, and will not let this product out of my clutches. It's highly moisturizing, and I can layer it on (though you really don't need much) without having my skin break out. Everyone who I've forced to try it agrees that it has an extremely pleasant hydrating sensation when it's first applied. It's as if you don't know how irritated your skin is until you smooth this on.",1
This is one of the few products I purchase again and again and again - I absolutely love it. I have combination skin that gets very dry and red in the winter and this is the only moisturizer that keeps the flakiness to a minimum. I use it year-round (though a lighter touch in the summer) and any time when my skin starts to feel irritated or sensitive from trying new products - this always calms it down without making me break out.,1
"I have normal skin with no acne but my skin is somewhat sensitive and I break out in a small hive or two on the daily for no apparent reason. I used this nightly for a month and really didn't see any difference between this and a drugstore brand moisturizer other than the consistency of this product is a little thick, very creamy, and easily absorbs into the skin within 5-10 mins. Not sure if I will be purchasing again. Only reason I would choose this over a cheaper brand is that I really do enjoy the consistency and I kind of like the weird smell.",1
"My skin has been crazy dry after moving from a beach city to the mountains. My usual moisturizer wasn't keeping up, and my skin was freaking out. I got a sample of this and my skin soaked it up! All the dry patches along my cheekbones and chin disappeared, but it did lightly break me out on my oily forehead if I apply too heavily. A little goes a long way, so I tap it on lightly over my oily T-bone and smooth it over my cherks, lip and chin, which tend to by prone to dryness. If you have dry skin, try this, it feels amazing!",1
"I adore this lotion. The last tube lasted approximately 3-4 months hoping that gives you an idea of the price. I find it to be just the right consistency. I put it over my Josie Maran Argan Oil to see exceptional soft and supple skin. I like the smell of it as well. I have combination dry skin, but it's slowly becoming normal as the season changes.",1
"I have very dry skin so I wanted a hydrating serum. This is a really large bottle, so it's a great deal for the price. However, after trying this for a few months I just don't think this is the product for me. First of all, the fourth ingredient is alcohol, which is strange considering it's supposed to be a moisturizing product. It also leaves my face very shiny, so I don't like using this in the mornings. I also believe this is causing some breakouts. When I first tried it, I noticed clogged pores and bumpy skin texture along my cheeks, and some small pimples popping up. I stopped using this and my face got better, but because this was such an expensive product, I gave it another shot. The clogged pores and bumps returned. They're not too noticeable so I might continue using this until I finish, but I'll never repurchase this, especially because there's so many cheaper and better hydrating serums out there.",0
"This will be my second time repurchasing this product. I don't know what it is about the Ceramidin line (I also use the cream and the sheet masks), but the stuff is borderline miraculous. Don't be fooled by the consistency of the product. It may be a liquid, but it is powerful. I have very dry skin that becomes patchy and scaly in the winter. Since I started using Dr. Jart+ about 1.5 years ago, those problems stopped almost overnight. ",1
This and the cream keep my skin feeling moisturized. A great combo. I wear it year round and have loved the results.,1
Adds a little kick to the moisturizer!!!,1
"I love this product. I have areas of my skin that get oily, and during the summer, I have difficulty finding moisturizers that won't give me white heads. During the summer, I use this as a light weight moisturizer. In the winter, I love this as a serum. It doesn't break me out, and it makes my skin visibly plumper.",1
"So I'll start by saying that I've tried every mainstream serum and oil you can think of, and nothing really worked or impressed me. I randomly got a sample of this because a Sephora employee was swearing/ranting about it, and I really wasn't interested in it at all (I think I was looking for a deep conditioner?) but I didn't want to be rude so I went along with it. 2 weeks later the sample is still in the bag and my skin felt a little drier than normal so I went ahead and popped it open and patted the strange substance into my skin after toning. Immediately I was obsessed. I reallyyyyy liked the way it plumped up my skin. And when I woke up, I felt like every product I used on my face the night before worked 10x better than normal, so of course I went back to Sephora that day and bought the full size. I've been using a couple drops of this under my oils and moisturizers ever since and wake up to hydrated and glowing skin :')",1
THE MOST LIGHWEIGHT CREAM EVER! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!,1
"Dr Jart has some of the best skincare products for sensitive and combination skin, I love the non greasy serum texture, I've repurchased many bottles over the years along with other Dr Jart products...unlike some of other over-hyped and overpriced products, this one really worth to try,even just for hydration...",1
"this stuff is worth every penny! i have dry, sensitive skin and i get bad texture all over my forehead. bought this because of the good reviews and was intrigued by its promises for quenching dry skin and it absolutely does! i even had to got out and buy the matching cream to pair with it (which i also highly recommend). it is so lightweight and is more hydrating than even the heaviest of creams. i didn't buy this to fix the bumps on my forehead but within two weeks of using this product they had all but disappeared! i stopped using it for 2 weeks while on vacation and the bumps popped right back up so this is definitely my miracle product! love all the dr jart products i've tried!!",1
The Ceramidin Liquid & Cream are go-to products for me. It dries very quickly and never irritates my skin. A little goes a long way--still on my first bottle even though I've been through a few tubes of the Cream.,1
"I Love this company, and this serum is a great complement to the cream. It is fast absorbing and perfect for layering under makeup. my skin has become sensitive and more dry since trialling many products to find what works for me, and this serum combined with the ceramidin cream always soothe my skin after I abuse it. definitely recommend for any and all skin types!!",1
"Without it, I can't go inn on in winter.",1
"Before this I was using the fresh rose deep hydrating serum, which was great to soothe my inflamed acne prone skin. But this stuff...it's just as good if not better! It hydrates, makes the skin feel so soft and just adds an extra boost of hydration to any moisturizer you put on after. Doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts which is a safe haven for me! I also appreciate how much more smoother makeup applies now after I added this into my skincare routine. Found my new forever serum!",1
"I have never really had bad skin. I get a pimple here and there but nothing dramatic. What I do have is texture around my cheek bones. When I put highlighter on it's a nightmare!!! This stuff though, after only a week of using it, no bumps at all! Amazing!",1
Tried this one in store today and had to buy it because it felt amazing on my combination skin type it's a great product to add to my daily routine,1
"This stuff makes my skin feel good, smoothes things out, can be mixed in makeup, acts as a primer...I love it so much. I have acne-prone freakout prone skin and this stuff makes me feel beautiful.",1
"this is definitely my new favourite moisturizer, my skin has never looked or felt better!",1
"I love the brand but particularly this product. It feels so hydrating and quenching for your skin. I am pale, late 20s, combination skin with a few stubborn recurring pimples and this feels soothing. It helps a bit with redness and gets absorbed quickly! it's watery, but feels lovely after you get over the initial oh it's not a cream moment. Highly recommend!",1
Honestly been on the fence about buying this serum as I have some left at home that I should use up before I buy another but those don't seem to be doing the job or helping my dry sensitive skin. I'm so glad I brought this my skin literally drinks it's up I even use it at an essence at times if I feel a little more dehydrated than usual.,1
I really do like this and just repurchased. I definitely notice a difference if I don't apply it before my moisturizer. ,1
"This product has made a huge difference in my skin for the better. When I used it for the first time, I woke up the next morning with more hydrated skin. My pores were noticeably smaller and my makeup goes on so much smoother on top of it. I love this product, especially because of how much it comes with for the price!",1
I started using this serum as part of my multi step skin care regimen. It made a notable difference in the softness of my skin. I'm a huge fan of Dr. Jart products and only wish I had tried this sooner.,1
This is a nice option for people looking for a very light Serum. I think this probably is best for people with oily to normal skin because it is lightly Hydrating. My only criticisms are the fact that it contains only one ceramide and the issue that denatured alcohol is one of the first ingredients. My more detailed review video is below.,1
"After reading other reviews and trying some of Dr. Jart+ products via Birchbox, I figured this was a safe bet. It is moisturizing without being heavy, yet enough to use on it's own if you're having an ""oily week."" I'm 32 and my skin sometimes looks dull, and this has added a nice glow and more youthful appearance to my skin. I use 3-4 drops on my face and neck, and expect this bottle will probably last me through the summer (bought at the end of January). Great buy if you're looking for something serum-like, but with a bit more moisture",1
My skin gets really tight after I use any Cleanser so having this serum during the winter months has been awesome. It's a very thin liquid but three drops is just enough for my face. My skin immediately soaks it up and it buys me some time to moisturize my body before I apply my moisturizer.,1
I've been using this more or less morning and night for 3 weeks and it's definitely improved the texture of my skin. I have combination skin that can be sensitive but I've experienced no issues.,1
"I like this because it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and it feels great going on. I was hoping it would replace my May Coop Raw Sauce, but I think May Coop edges out over this product for how it makes my skin more radiant. ",1
I have always had really dry skin but ever since I started using this my skin has not been dry AT ALL! I also have very sensitive skin and this is so great for it. I use it under my daily moisturizer and it really is like a drink of water for your face.,1
"I've owned this for less than 24 hours and felt a difference immediately. I have steroid induced rosacea and my nose is flakey and exceptionally dry, nothing has helped except this! Less than one day and the crust is gone! I see a difference on my whole face! LOVE!",1
Bought this when a brand rep was in the store. She swore it was a holy grail product. I tried it for three weeks and noticed absolutely nothing. Returned it. I honestly felt like it was just a bottle filled with cloudy water.,0
Rec'd this as a sample and was not impressed. Left my dry skin itchy and read. Did not moisturize at all. Would not buy this product.,0
"More of a serum than a cream or lotion, this product is nevertheless extremely good value for how long it lasts. I used it over the summer when all I needed was a lightweight moisturizer. Doesn't irritate your skin or clog pores.",1
"I can't believe I just got this product recently! I wish I had had it for all of the past winters when my skin was so dry and flaky. I use this morning and night, and truly feel that it seals in all of the moisture I've given my skin with essences and serums. I've barely experienced any dryness since I started using this - would absolutely purchase again when I run out.",1
I use this under the Dr Jart Ceramidin cream at night and in the morning under my daytime moisturizer (Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation). It's a serum and I don't find it sticky at all. It hydrates and plumps my skin up. My makeup goes on beautifully over this liquid. I have seen a huge difference in my skin since starting the Ceramidin line. It's a lifesaver for dry sensitive skin.,1
"I need the moisture boost as it gets cold, and this is perfect. I'm not out of moisturizer yet, but as soon as I run out, I'm grabbing the Cream...and maybe the Day Tint. Dr. Jart+ hit it out of the park with this- it's light, not greasy, smells medicinal in a fresh way (and if that's not your thing, the smell dissipates pretty quickly)...and it works. The change in my skin is noticeable.",1
Worth every penny. Great for people with dry skin.. I use it as a serum under the Ceramidin gel,1
"I love the way this serum feels when it goes on. It has a light floral scent and it feels very moisturizing. Perfect for my dry sensitive skin in the winter months. Also, I used it under my regular moisturizer and I thought it worked great.",1
Absolutely must have for dehydrated skin,1
Dr Jart where have u been all my life??? The liquid and cream are the perfect combo ! My face never been so smooth and my make up never looked so flawless ! Even my brow wiz applies 100x smoother and better!,1
If you suffer from ANYTHING this will help your skin and repair it.,1
"I don't believe this product can stand alone, the cream however can. I bought it after seeing that the cream recommended using it with the lotion and they do complement each other quite well I feel that it preps the skin and makes sure you are getting the full effectiveness of the cream",1
I cannot express how important this product is to my skin care regime. It sets the perfect balance for hydrating my skin and prepping it to receive either my day or night cream. Love the fresh scent and will repurchase over and over again!,1
I have combo sensitive skin. I was introduced to this through a facial perk I did at my local sephora. I liked how it didn't burn my skin. And it was used a long with the water drops moisturizer. It is light weight not weird and sticky like many moisturizers. I did get some pimples but that always happen after a facial. I also was using the Dr. Jart micro water as a toner cause it says it tones. I stopped using to see if I stop getting pimples. I'll keep using this a long with the water drops moisturizer and see how it goes through out the week.,1
Smelled horrible so I couldn't even uses it long enough to see if it was moisturizing and repairing. Returning it,0
"I really wanted to like this. Unfortunately, it irritated and dried my skin out, I think because of the high amount of alcohol.",0
"I got this as a sample and I'm using this as my daytime moisturizer until the sale. This is a no-nonsense lotion, no fragrance, no frills, and would work well for those with sensitive or allergic skin, too. The ceramides moisturize and provide a barrier, ""locking"" water in the skin to prevent dryness. I personally like natural fragrances and oils so I tend to purchase those types of moisturizers. However, I can see myself using it in the future. I love the texture and the simple packaging - clinical or apothecary type labeling is cute. Also, there are different formulations for the time of year/climate and skin type you have. The price isn't too expensive either so you really can't go wrong with this one.",1
I use this with the ceramidin cream. I'm on my second bottle of it and am about to buy my third tube of the cream. I love them both. I'm 35 and these products have changed my skin. It's glowing and never ever dry anymore (even in NY winters). I will never switch to another serum and cream!,1
"This liquid lotion / serum is great. I was suffering from very dry skin with flaky patches and I tried everything to get my skin to the point that I could wear my tinted foundation without having to put more lotion on to quench the dry patches. This product has done amazing things for my skin. No more dry skin or flaky patches of skin. I did read all of the reviews other purchasers wrote so I thought I would give it a try since Sephora is so great about taking back products you are not happy with. If you are suffering from the same kind of problem I was, don't hesitate to purchase this product ~ it has been a god send for me!",1
"I'm 52 and have been using serums for over 30 years. Have used high end, mid priced and nothing ever, ever gave me the hydration Ceramidin does. I made the purchase after reading several reviews, not only on Sephora, but other sites as well. From the first application, I felt the difference, and after about 3 days, I started seeing plumping and glowing, hydrated skin. I use along with Ceramidin Cream, or Gel Cream.",1
"I love this moisturizer! I have mild rosacea and while it doesn't reduce redness it definitely doesn't make things worse. I was using other ""gentle"" moisturizers and even those were stinging after washing my face. This didn't have that effect at all. I got a sample of the Cermadin cream which I use over the liquid on places where my face is really dry and it works great, I will be ordering a full size!",1
"This is a great light lotion for the summer. It is very liquid, so be careful when you squeeze it out. I also found that the product worked best if I shook the bottle before. The lotion works great for humid, hot climates, but now that the weather in New England is cooling down, I need a more moisturizing product.",1
"I have extremely dry skin, not flaky, but face feels tight immediately after washing and need mid-day replenishment. I used this product together with the Ceramidin Cream, but this combination was not moisturizing enough for me unfortunately.",0
"I have tried several moisturizers including the 100 dollar and over ones. This one is the best! I also use it with the ceramidin cream. My skin looks gorgeous and healthy. I use Retin A nightly and Dr. Jart ceramidin is the best compliment to help your skin to reduce redness, and retain moisture! Thank you DrJart for this exceptional product!",1
"I use this serum with the Dr. Jart ceramidin cream and my oily/acne-prone skin loves it! It does not cause me any breakouts for me, if anything I think it helps heal my pimples. My skin never responded well to traditional oily or acne products. All they ever did was dry me out and exacerbate the problems! Dr. Jart's ceramidin line has transformed my skin!!",1
"I pair this with the Ceramidin cream in the winter. I've tried so many products for my combination, reactive skin and they're the only ones that combat dryness, flakiness and redness without breaking me out or piling under other products. Can't live without them!",1
"I have dry skin and this makes my skin feel so soft and smooth and hydrated. It glides over my other serum without pilling at all. I use it day and night, 3 drops. Looooove it!",1
I love this product! My face would always get so dry and my makeup would always look so flaky by the end of the day. With this product my face and complexion looks sooooo amazing ! It also reduced the redness of my Rosacea! I will definitely be buying and going to try the cream next!,1
"This has done amazing things for my skin! In the summer heat I used it on it's own and it balanced my dry skin without making it oily, and I'm sure I will continue to repurchase!",1
"I have sensitive/combo skin with an oily tzone. I use the Ceramidin Cream during the day which is perfect. I wasn't sure if this would be TOO much hydration or not, but it's perfect. I use this at night underneath First Aid Beauty Intense Hydration oatmeal cream. In only 3 nights of using this, it seems to have smoothed out some texture and it is curing my eczema on my face. I love this. My new staple in my routine.",1
"At first when I tried this product I wasn't really into it. But then I tried using it in conjunction with my regular moisturizer (put this serum on first, moisturizer second) and LOVED it. For whatever reason, using it with my normal moisturizer makes my skin look dewy and healthy. I'm now hooked, and may have to check my bag on every trip now just so I can take this with me.",1
"This has really helped with my dry skin. I would constantly have flaky, dull skin on my face but when I started using this with the Dr. Jart water drop my face is (nearly) flawless.",1
"okay so im on accutane and my skin is the driest thing ever and I went into Sephora to get some skincare and the lady gave me a sample of this and let me tell you, it calmed down my skin so much and gave me a smooth surface to work with, especially considering I can't exfoliate. I'll definitely purchase a bottle when I get the chance.",1
"It gives extra hydration to my skin!! Very light, absorbs quickly!",1
"Ok, so I've been on the look out for a new moisturizer.... it's been about 6 month... i have very dry skin yet it gets oily only on my nose area. I was using Belief both formulas, Korres Rose oil , and finished up another one I can't remember... so i love the Korres one but it's just not good in the warmer weather for me or I was just too dry/dehydrated. I was recommended this by Susan at Sephora. She is amazing at helping out with skin issues, she guided me and asked me all sorts of questions and about my concerns. She came up with this due to my skin not working well with sun screen in my foundation nor moisturizer. She told me to just use this and only a bit... she didn't think i needed the cream. It would be too much. Well I bought the full size. AND OMG! It was exactly what my skin needed. It was perfect for my everyday wear, under my foundation and under sunscreen. I recommend trying this out for people with dry skin yet have oily areas. you will not regret it.",1
I'm more than halfway through the bottle and I can't really tell a difference. Will finish out the product on my dÃ©colletage and try something else on my face.,1
"I am so impressed with this product and found that my skin looked so noticeable better using it that I got compliments. I could see in the mirror that my normally extremely dry skin looked hydrated and healthier. Unfortunately, when I went to the local department store that has a small Sephora shop they were all sold out. Rather than order it or return to the store I tried a new product that has been a dismal disappointment and was more expensive. I'm coming back to this product because it works as advertised and I found the scent pleasant",1
I love how lightweight and moisturizing this liquid is! It gives me a nice glow when I use it.,1
In AZ it is very dry plus I'm over 60. This product did not do much for me UNDER my eyes. But it kept my upper lid area dry so that my droopy skin did not rub off my eyeliner. Not vain enough for an eye lift.,1
"I purchased this because I have suddenly been having issues with dry, flaky skin on my eyelids and on the corners of my mouth--not sure if it's age, stress, etc. It is a new issue for me and one that I was unsure how to combat. I was using cortisone cream and also started taking a B vitamin supplement. ",1
"When I ordered this, I tried it for a day or two, and then put it aside. In my head, I wanted something that off the bat had the wow factor. A few months later (product is good once open for 12 months), I was desperate, and gave it a go. I was battling being dry, acne, and the heat of 100+ temps. This product works and it is a slow progression, but it is constant improvement. Once you use it for a solid two weeks, you will start to notice improvement in the texture and tone of your skin. Your skin will become more hydrated, the redness in my skin decreased by more than 50%, and I no longer look irritated. ",1
"I use this with the Ceramidin cream by Dr. Jart at night. I mix the two together in my hands and apply to the skin. I have used this combination for a while, and every time I try something else I come, almost immediately, back to these two. My skin looks plump, more clear, experience less breakouts, and feels comfortable. It is not an inexpensive duo, but my skin seems to prefer this combination above all others. My best skin results from these two products. They are both an absolute must have for me. I can't find anything else that even comes close. Highly recommend.",1
This product went smoothly on my face yes it's a little bit sticky once it dried out but wait for another minute or 2 the stickiness will be gone. I honestly like this one far better than the creamI find this more hydrating. IfI need held it topIt off with a sleeping mask or the belifMoisturizing cream. Will definitely repurchase this product and a little 5-8 drops covers the face down to neck.,1
"Y'all. I have the WORST Eczema on my face. I hate using steroid creams when I have a big breakout plus I need something to use as preventative treatment. Well, this weekend I had the worst Eczema breakout I have had in a while. Whole face was red, SO itchy, SO dry and nothing was helping. I had tried this as a sample before so I figured what the heck I'll buy the full size. The same day I applied it, the itchiness, redness and pain went away. I am not exaggerating! In less than 24 hours I saw a HUGE improvement. I put this on first, then an OTC made-for-Eczema face lotion and it is the perfect combo for summer. Once it gets cooler, I will layer with the Ceramidin Cream. This stuff is amazing and I will never be without it again. It saved my skin!!",1
"I love the smell, the texture, everything! Love the way it feels and what it does for my skin! Im such a huge fan of all Dr. Jart products, what a fantastic value.",1
Didn't do any damage or break me out but saw almost no results. Followed with a ceramidin cream and saw no difference between the cream alone and when I used it with the extra Dr. Jart+ layer underneath. Will return.,0
"I've been searching for a moisturizer that works wonders on my dry/dehydrated skin. It wasn't until recently that I did some research and discovered that any oily T-zone (that came with adult acne) I had was due to lack of moisture and hydration. Once I changed my skin care regimen from acne based (which further dried out my skin causing it to produce more oil) to one that treats dry/dehydrated skin, my face was drastically different. I use this followed by Dr. jart cream (as recommended) and my face has never been clearer or more hydrated.",1
Three to four drops of this twice a day for 2 months have hardly put a dent in the bottle! Easily a year's supply and SO worth it. ,1
"Can I just say I love pretty much everything that comes from Dr. Jart? It took me a while to start using this because out of nowhere my skin decided to become sensitive. Anything new, even pricey products would make my skin break out. This I was hesitant because my skin was clear and I didn't want to spend time to heal myself if I broke out again. But the complete opposite!!! My skin is smoother, softer, and def has an inner glow look to it. This is my new obsession and will not leave my routine!!! LOVE",1
Didn't realize how dependent I'd become on this stuff until I ran out and my skin was dull and dry. Really great before moisturizer. Love it so much I just bought the gel cream too.,1
"I know folks have been calling this a serum, and I get that it has the texture of a serum, but besides adding hydration, it doesn't promise any of the other benefits of other serums. That said, it's a fantastic moisturizer! It's lightweight yet packs a good punch of moisture, and I actually prefer this over it's sibling, the Ceramidin Cream, which is much thicker. I use the Ceramidin Liquid every night as the last step in my pre-bed ritual and every morning before I put on makeup. It dries quickly and keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. I use about a quarter-sized smear for my entire face and neck.",1
"I tried on back of my hand, it felt very light and moisturizing...like serum type of texture. Love it..looking to buy a full size!",1
I had a sunburn. I went to the collins sephora and a woman called Maria helped me. This cream is amazing! In one day my sun burn started to disappear.,1
"Great lightweight way to add moisture to your face and definitely helped with my winter dryness. It's also a really reasonable priced product, which is great. It didn't totally rock my world, but it's definitely a solid serum to add some very lightweight moisture.",1
"I love this product. It's so easy to use, and you can use it many different ways. You could mix in a drop with your eye cream or lip balm, or add it to your moistuizer. I smetimes rub on a few drops after using a product that I know is drying, like my retinol. Keep in mind this isn't technically an anti-ager so it doesn't have a lot of ""active"" ingredients. It's simply going to be very hydrating and help maintain your skin's moisture barrier. Even though it is very hydrating, it absorbs extremely quickly and never feels greasy. I will definitely buy again.",1
I use this product before I moisturize and it gives me some added moisture and makes my skin look dewy. I have very dry skin so its a great way for me to add extra moisture. Its not think and it absorbs quickly. Love this. I cant wait to just use it alone in the summer when I want that dewy look,1
"I don't have particularly dry skin, so I got this as a light moisturizer. I was underwhelmed. It left my skin sort of sticky and almost greasy. The smell was nice though.",0
"I wrote a review for the Ceramidin Cream so I was thinking I should write a review for this as well since I use this liquid first, then the cream on top.This liquid/serum + cream combo has honestly saved my skin. I'm asian, with dry sensitive skin. The amore pacific future defense was a waste of money and my face started getting red bumps as well as dry patches. This product is amazing! My skin is great, soft, amazing under my Nars foundation. I learned my lesson that the pricier a product is, doesn't necessarily mean it is better (amore pacific $200+). Thank you Dr.Jart for my holy grail!!!",1
"I got this product, and the coordinating cream because I've loved my Dr. Jart+ BB cream. I'm still not sure how I feel about it, and I've been using it for a couple months.",1
"It smells like an expensive spa mask. It feels amazing and absorbs decently fast. My skin is SO dry that it cracks, and this is a blessing for me.",1
This toner/serum works perfectly as a prep for moisturizing. I use it immediately after cleansing and apply it to my damp face and pat in upwards movement until it's nearly dry. It leaves my skin dewy and allows the cream to absorb & it stays dewy pretty much all day long. It's light and there isn't much of a scent so it can be great for dry or sensitive skin.,1
"Started using AHAs on my skin. Got back from a long day and noticed my entire chin was dry and flaky. Used more moisturizer the next day, at lunch my skin was flaky again, so made an emergency trip into Sephora decided to grab the Ceramidin Liquid. After that my skin stayed moisturized and flake free all day. Used it under my normal moisturizer. May splurge and try the cream as well. Worth the price. Great item!",1
"No matter how mild winters are, as soon as the weather changes, my skin goes out of whack. Every winter I struggle with trying to find products hydrating enough to calm my dry, irritated, and slightly red skin. After reading about the reviews from other users, I decided to splurge on this purchase (anything to calm my sensitive, combination dry skin!) ",1
"I purchased this because I needed extra moisture. This product wound up causing blemishes and I discontinued use. I do have acne prone skin, but my skin stays clear unless I use a product that clogs my pores. I have a friend who was complaining about her skin being dry so I had her try this as she does not have acne prone or sensitive skin. She loves this product and continued using is each night.",1
"I have struggled with adult-onset acne since I was about 19 years old. I'm now 40, so, yeah. It's been a long battle. My skin is also pale and extremely sensitive. I have tried just about everything on the market, and I've spent a pretty penny doing it. I can honestly say that the combination of the Dr. Jart+ ceramidin liquid and cream has been my skin's saviour. It finally feels soft, not oily, calm, and mostly clear. It's amazing. I will occasionally add a drop of Nude oil into the liquid before I apply if my skin feels tight. It takes very little of both products to fully cover my face, neck, and dÃ©colletage. I really can't recommend this enough.",1
"I have terribly dry skin that gets awful in the winter. My usual foundation looked so patchy on me, and no other foundation was working either. Instead, I tried this - and my skin has never been so moisturized! My makeup no longer clings to dry patches and it creates a beautiful canvas. I use it on clean skin before moisturizer and it dries very quickly.",1
"This stuff is the real deal. I use it with the Ceramidin Gel Cream in the am and the Ceramidin Cream in the pm. Within a week, my skin was more even and the redness was almost gone. After 2 weeks, my skin was definitely smoother, diminished lines and less crepey. I've found the fountain of youth!",1
"Amazing serum! Cream idea are amazing! I'm 30 and have always moisturized since I was a teen, I often get complimented for looking around 21-22. But this is absolutely awesome. The more moisture your skin gets the better and I have severely dry skin with eczema. Somehow this saved me. I will never go without it! Even my fine lines I had coming the crowd feet of my eyes are gone and it makes your face feel amazing soft and evens it out. I pour a dime size amount and par it on, the rest I don't waste by running it into my hands :) luckily I live in Korea and I can get it for half the price! But I did get my first bottle from Sephora and fell in love :) highly recommend!",1
"I'm so glad i discovered this little treasure, it's lightweight but does it's job of moisturizing very well, My skin is very fickle minded, one day it's super oily and breaking out or no reason and super dry sometimes, The best part is I can adjust the level of moisture by just altering the amount of the product I put on my face, I've noticed that my skin looks hydrated and plumped when I use this serum, Overall, I highly recommend this product.",1
"I'm sure this works for some people, but I couldn't get past the smell, I had to wash my face and hands multiple times to get the smell off. Bottom line - if you are at all smell sensitive, make sure to do sniff test before buying.",0
I have been using this product for almost one year. I am on my second bottle. I use a toner before this and my serum(s) after. I notice my skin absorbs the products better now. It immediately makes dull skin look refreshed.,1
"I can't say enough good things about this serum. Started using it along with the ceramidin cream and this duo has transformed my dry winter skin into soft, happy, even skin. It creates the most beautiful canvas for makeup application. I use the May Coop raw sauce under this and the ceramidin cream and every day is a good skin day. To steal a phrase I read here in another review, this is Jesus in a bottle.",1
"My skin has been rough, red and super dehydrated lately. After using this and nothing else AM and PM for a few days, I have noticed a massive difference. my skin is way less red, less dry and just less dead looking. It gives a nice glow and makeup goes on wonderfully. Even my sister noticed a huge difference. You don't need a lot to use for your face and neck, so this will last eons.",1
Simply amazing! My skin has been so dry this winter and this serum really help with my dry patched (forehead and cheeks). I used the May Coop Raw Sauce and it doesn't compare to this one. The Raw Sauce works well but only temporarily because my dry patches tend to return. I use the Ceramidin Liquid at night and I find that my skin feels soft the next day.,1
"I have combination skin - extremely dry with a constant layer of excessive oil later in the day, and this product is great for both.",1
This is my go-to serum now. I can skip toner and just apply this right after i was my face. Its super moisturizing and hydrating. Im in love with this. Great price for the amount it comes with. I will always stock up on these from now.,1
"My skin has gotten super dry in the canadian winter and before this, just used a facial oil. While it's good, the oil doesn't moisturise enough. With a few drops of this underneath and the oil on top, my skin has gotten much more plump and less tight. I have combo skin and this doesn't break my skin out or irritate my eczema patches.",1
"I LOVE this product. I have between using Clinique and Origins face cream, and lately because of postnatal hormones and the cold weather my skin has been flaking off. I got this product as a skin IQ recommendation and saw an immediate difference. I kept everything else in my routine the same and my skin feels amazing!",1
"I have been using .05% Retin-A to try and get my acne under control and along with a very cold and dry winter, my skin has been disgustingly crunchy, dry and flaky. This stuff within a day or two saved my dry disgusting skin.",1
"I was somewhat weary of the product when I first saw the price. However, it is worth every penny. The product leaves my skin moist even during the worst dry winter days as the heat blows throughout the day. It definitely is a great complement to any moisturizing lotion or cream you may have that already works well for you.",1
Absorbs quickly into my skin. Leaves it feeling so plump and moisturized. I use it after Raw Sauce and before my sunscreen/moisturizer. I have moderately sensitive skin and this hasn't upset it at all. I kind of dig the basic clean packaging too.,1
"I'm a huge fan of this serum -- it really sinks into my skin and helps it retain moisture. My skin is dry and tends to overproduce oil, so I love how lightweight this feels and how effective it is. Have also definitely noticed that it fills out some fine lines & makes me look better rested than I actually am.",1
Got a sample of this when i went to sephora to pick up Dr.Jarts Ceramidin Gel Cream (amazing BTW) and i absolutely love this sooo much!!!! Its soo light weight but it just does something so magical to my skin that it just helps my rosacea out and breakouts! Ughhh i love this so much and i dont think im ever gonna try anything else!,1
"I have very dry skin already, but between my retinoid (drying) and the winter (even more drying), I really struggle keeping the moisture in. I've used the companion product face cream, but was skeptical to try this. While I wasn't initially blown away, come day three I was amazed at the results. A small dime-sized amount of the liquid gently patted on my face morning and night has done wonders. While it's very light, it's incredibly hydrating.",1
"I use this liquid with the ceramidin cream, which has helped so much with my dry cheeks. The liquid is very lightweight, almost reminds me of some Korean essence/toner in terms of texture. It soaks into my skin very quickly but leaves a slight sticky/tackiness to my skin.",1
I am obsessed with using this after my toner and essence. It allows the moisturizer to absorb so nicely into the skin. A little goes a long way and your skin looks and feels amazing. You do notice a difference and if you think about it - it'll also help against aging because if you stay hydrated then your skin will stay supple. I also love layering this with other serums with other benefits.,1
"I have dry, sensitive skin and am eczema-prone and for over a year, I had a couple of big flaky patches on my chin that I just could not get rid of without using a steroidal cream.",1
"This is absolutely amazing! Even though it's not a serum, I use it as one. It beats any other serum I've ever tried. After I use my toner, I put 5 drops of this on my face and then followed by moisturizer, and the moisturizer absorbs way better. The next day, my skin has this dewy glow and look even toned like it never had before. It did not break me out so it's a ++++.",1
One of the first products I bought on my mission to hydrate my skin. It is a great serum. Loved the scent. You get A LOT of product for the price.,1
I'm not surprised this product is always sold out. I use this with the dr Jart cream and my skin is stunning!!,1
Words...can't describe my feelings for this Ceramidin Liquid. I should note that use this along with the Ceramidin Cream (it's suggested to use them together).,1
"I love Dr. Jart products. I rarely reuse the same product but am in love with this line. In the winter my skin gets very dry and flaky to the point where it looks like I'm breaking out. Furthermore, my legs very very itchy. Some days I scratch so much, I bleed! This stuff is a miracle worker. I use a few drops on my face and from time to time, my shins. It relieved my itchy skin last winter better than anything I've used.",1
"Ceramides are amazing for healing and repairing skin. This liquid plumps and brightens skin, making it look better and better every day. Layer this under a thicker moisturizer if your skin is dry, but if your skin is oily/combo like mine, this is a perfect last layer to repair your moisture barrier and control sebum production. This product is a game changer!",1
"I used to use this and loved it but over the summer months I tried something else because I never loved the powdery scent this has. However, my husband continues to use this and when I feel my face is slightly irritated from a mask or scrub, I apply this before my night cream and it acts as a booster. Nice, lightweight fluid.",1
Sounds like a commercial for tummy meds but this is what I felt when I needed some savior for my burning red skin.I was using a serum with vitamin C and totally flared up my questionable rosacea skin that I went from dealing with mild rosy cheeks to purple skin!!,1
"This stuff is really really good. I've tried lots of oils and serums to help with my crazy dry skin in the winter, but I'm always getting those terrible flakes mid-day! This seems to do the trick. It keeps my skin moisturized all day. It doesn't have a fancy smell or fancy packaging, because it doesn't need it. It works!",1
It's light and moisturizes my dry skin very well. I use this serum twice a day under my night or day cream and my skin looks soft and smooth.,1
"I love this liquid. I apply it with my fingers between toning and moisturizing, although sometimes I feel like I don't even need to moisturize after this. I like the thin, watery consistancy. My skin drinks it up and glows. I find it also helps reduce my naturally flushed cheeks. I apply it heavily aorund my eyes and even my eyelids (which can get very dry) and it's very soothing and non-irritating. Very happy.",1
"I have dry very sensitive skin. I'll admit I'm a makeup skin care junkie and I am a sucker I'll try anything once. Always hoping that something will actually work wonders! I can hands down say this is liquid magic! Super light weight, didn't break my skin out, completely got rid of my dry patchy skin I had! Makeup goes on way smoother now, oh and NOT OILY! I will re buy this over and over Again.",1
Does everything the product description claims. I can't believe how lightweight yet moisturizing it is. Couldn't be happier.,1
"I'm not sure about the skin benefits, but I do know that it makes my foundation look amazing. I can tell a difference when I don't use it. I received it as a sample, will buy. Bravo Dr. Jart+.",1
"This is a great moisturizer that sinks in and plumps my skin. I am 54 yet still get the occasional acne flare-up. I think this lotion helps calm my skin and reduce breakouts. When I am extra dry, I use the ceramidin cream for some additional moisture.",1
"This liquid is absolutely wonderful. It smooths and moisturizers the skin. I sometimes use it alone if I'm in a hurry, but, when I use this underneath the ceramidin cream, it is amazing! My skin has Never looked better! Seriously, these products belong together. They really do wonders and will last a long time too!",1
"This makes my skin feel silky and it's not sticky or greasy. This might be irritating to sensitive skin because it has a lot of alcohol (it's the 5th listed ingredient), and it has a bunch of essential oils (patchouli, citrus, rose geranium, sage, moss rose, and kudzu). Ceramide does wonders for my skin. Here are all the ingredients (from the box):",1
"I've had this for several months and I am here to report that it does nothing. It's basically thick water. Does nothing at all for my skin. Nothing. And if you get a little on your lips, it tastes quite awful. Don't bother.",0
"I tried this last night mixed with ny normal andalou goji peptide cream and wow! My skin had a glowy layer when I woke. Natural oils good! Also I LOVE the smell idk why people complain about it. It smells like lavender and pepper like an expensive spa,",1
"Wanted to love it as it had great claims, but it irritated my skin! I found it has denatured alcohol, so not great for sensitive skin!",0
"Reasonably priced, works on dehydrated skin helping it retain moisture. Helps reduce damage. I can't even count how many serums I have tried. All price ranges, all brands",1
Hi have dry combination skin that is extremely sensitive... Up to this day I used exclusively an expensive natural cream from my dermatologist... This liquid combined with the ceramidin cream are the only creams I have encountered that do not cause irritation burning or breakouts --- true skin saver!! I now have dewy glow moisturized skin! Thank you!,1
"Honestly I have nothing to complain about it.If you watch my skincare routine (at YouTube channel MyTopThingsss), it's my day cream nowadays.",1
"This stuff is great. By using this in conjunction with the ceramidin cream, my skin has finally bounced back after it's winter dry-out. I have mild eczema and it really flared up on me this year. I like the liquid because I can use 4-5 drops on my face and my skin drinks it in. I also use a few drops on my neck which had been flakey and tight prior to using this stuff. Good product, and I think I could use it as my only moisturizer once summer hits.",1
"I love this stuff! Just started using it a few weeks ago and already see a significant difference in my skin. I put it on immediately after washing my face in the morning and in the evening. It locks in the moisture and creates supple, soft, and moisturized skin. I foresee myself using this for a long time!",1
"While this feels ""thin"" and liquidy to the hand, on the face it is a great serum base layer that is very satisfying. You need only the size of a dime to cover your face and a bit more for the neck.. Tons of value with the pick up!",1
I Love dr jarts' ceramidin line. i purchased this liquid to use under the ceramidin cream for day time under makeup. it helps to keep my face hydrated all day long and my make up looks so much better with it underneath.,1
"I have very dry, sensitive skin that is prone to clogged pores and breakouts.I use this liquid with the Ceramidin cream and it is a great combo. I also use it with the Dr Jart+ BB creams and other moisturisers and it boots their moisture power when it isn't quite enough.This line is my go-to when my skin is irritated and freaking out. It feels calming and medicinal.I gave it a four because I don't think I would die without it but I'm sure glad I have it!!!",1
"This stuff is awesome! I have very dry hands in the winter and moderately dry hands in the summer. I wash my hands a lot and I hate the feeling of lotion which is why my hands often crack and bleed and it's very painful! The thing I like about this liquid is that it isn't sticky or slick, it sinks in fast and it sooths without burning! My neice is a nurse and she showed me her hands and she had a red rash around both writsts where she washes her hands so much daily and I recommended this to her and she loves it too! I will definitely keep this product in stock at all times because I can use it day or night and not have that gross feeling of regular lotion but all the soothing benifits and it doesn't have a bad smell which is a plus!",1
I love this stuff. I purchased the help me set with the cream as well. I will be buying this again! This winter was brutal in the Northeast and this keep my skin dewy all winter. Not one dry patch. The smell is amazing as well.,1
"After a month, I saw no difference in my dry skin, so back it went. Still searching for the holy grail of moisturizers...",1
"This product does what it states. It seals in moisture and protects skin from the elements, even in very cold, dry climates. Works best with the moisturizer of the same line. Smells clinical but the effectiveness makes it worth it.",1
"So far so good. The winter throws my skin some serious blows. On the perimeter of my chin, around my mouth, nose, small parts of my cheek, and on my forehead get irritable dry patches and its just such a battle to find a product that will assist. I turned to natural remedies for a long time, highly absorbent coconut oil mostly, as a sealer of moisture, but the oiliness of the coconut oil made makeup application a little bit messy. I spent over a year in Korea, and Dr. Jart is everyywhheere. Korea has an enormous, overwhelming, skin care market, so its nearly impossible to know whats hoopla and whats legit, so I ignored it. Upon returning to the states, and seeing Dr. Jart on Sephora and other leading dept. sites, I decided to give it a try, and am glad I did! Once the cream is available, I will pair it with that for a full skin care regimen, but with just this liquid, the dry patches are gone, my skin isn't irritated, and my face is actually touch-ably smooth. Thank goodness. Side note: apply to skin when the skin is moist but not wet. Im so used to applying moisturizers when my face is still a bit wet, but this formula gets kind of lost in the moisture. Dry until moist to the touch and slather it on! Great product, and looking forward to trying others.",1
"The hype is real. Buy it. I am very particular about my skincare products, and this stuff is liquid gold. Plumps, firms, and smooths skin. I basically replaced my toner with this and it's incredible even without the moisturizer on top. Addictive.",1
in wintertime i combined it the dr. jart oil balm or the jart cream or beauty balm especially when the winter is really harsh. i am also gonna keep using it in the summer or all year long because i love the feel of it.it makes my skin soft to touch and improves my liquid foundation or bb creams.,1
"Let me start out that you must use the smallest amount because it can get pretty sticky. For me it seems to offer more hydration when applied under my day lotion and CC cream. It does not seem to really make a difference w/ any of my night creams. Lets just say this product doesn't ""wow"" me.",1
"The texture of this product is very liquid-y and it is very hydrating! I use this after a toner and before a moisturizer and it creates a coat layer on the skin which makes my skin absorb the moisturizer better. I have a fairly dry combination skin, but this serum works well enough that I don't feel the need to use the Ceramidin cream with it. It smells a bit like medicine but I don't mind it at all because it works so well.",1
"Love the thin texture and it soaks in quickly. It smells like my Grandpa's Old Spice, but really, I don't mind that. Since using it, my skin has not felt that tight dry feeling.",1
This face wash is absolutely amazing. I have sensitive skin and found many gentle cleansers do not clean my skin properly. This one does! Not gritty either,1
"I originally bought this last spring & found it too moisturizing for my combination skin so I saved it for wintertime when I get dry and flaky. I'm so glad I did because it has saved my skin. I use it after cleansing with Dove Shea butter soap, Murad Vitamin C serum, AM & PM it is liquid y and light but very moisturizing, slightly tacky until fully dry.In AM my skin feels soft and moisturized but not greasy. You only need 3-4 drops of this serum so the bottle lasted me 5 months so it's a good buy.Recently I was outside for several hours in 10 degree windy weather and my cheeks were bright red and chapped. I applied a warm wet washcloth for a few minutes and then a few drops of Ceramidin, my skin was instantly soothed and the redness diminished soon after. This serum has a slight green tea fragrance that I find very mild and doesn't linger. Highly recommend for sensitive dry skin!!",1
"I have eczema and dry skin and the NY winter has not been kind to my skin this year. I had tried numerous different lotions, oils and combinations of the above and still had dry, itchy, flaking skin until someone at sephora suggested this as it would help my skin keep the moisture barrier that it naturally lacks due to eczema. I am rarely amazed by something but I was by this. It makes my skin smooth and soft, even when I fell asleep with only this product on and no moisturizer, I still woke up the next morning with soft skin.I put it on dry skin, until my face feels slighty sticky, and then follow with my regular moisturizer. If necessary I might add a little of this after the moisturizer as well.For everyone with dry irritated sensitive skin I highly recommend this.",1
"I have very sensitive skin with mild rosacea. The NY winter had made my skin so dry and dehydrated, that not even my La Mer cream helped. I tried a sample of this liquid, and it literally changed my skin in a few days. It's a thick liquid that leaves your skin feeling a bit tacky which I actually love. I layer my cream over the liquid and then put a second layer on top. It makes my skin feel soft, plump and well moisturizered!",1
I use this with the Ceramidin cream and my dry skin is better than ever. I have very dry (sometimes flaky) and sensitive skin. The Ceramidin products have done a great job hydrating skin and making it finally feel normal. I have not had any issues with irritation or breakouts. You do need to use an SPF because of the alpha-hydroxys.,1
I just reviewed the Ceramidin cream and this works well with it! So happy I found this. Works really well with my combination and sensitive skin and def works with this winter weather. My skin is glowing!,1
"I have sensitive and dry skin. I used this the first time with a koh gen do cream and it was too harsh. It did not seem to hydrate, in fact my chin still had dry patches and my face was oily in the middle of the day.. I wanted it so badly to work because of the good reviews and price so I gave it 2 other tries but stopped when it gave me three big zits.. I tried the koh gen do cream alone and my skin got so much better",0
"I usually don't write reviews, but this product deserves a write-up. I have eczema and I've tried everything when my skin flares up - even prescription creams from my dermatologist. This moisturizer beats them all. It not only reduced my last flare-up by several days, it has prevented its return. It's light enough to use on your body or your face, and won't clog pores. I use it every day, now. It's well worth the price. ",1
this one is a little gem. Would have never come across. Sephora Associate recommended .....Does the job better than a $200 SERUMTotally inexpensive for what you get!LOVE IT !!!!,1
"i had high hopes after reading the reviews, and I do love it but it caused me to break out on my chin. I never have breakouts on my chin, so I knew it was the liquid causing it. If it didn't break me out it would be an amazing product.",0
Very hydrating but has a weird chemical smell.,1
This hydrating liquid is just what my dry winter skin needs. I've layered this under Dr Jart Cream and the two work so beautifully together. My skin is more moisturized and healthy than it has been in quite awhile. I've tried so many serums looking for one that would work with my dry in winter/sensitive/combination skin and now I finally have!,1
HG doesn't even begin to describe it. I now live my life in fear of this product being out of stock or discontinued.,1
"I've been using this on my skin for about six months now, off and on, and I've definitely noticed a difference in the quality of my skin. I have rosacea, and the affected areas are generally a little rougher and somewhat pebbly, as well as dry. Pairing this liquid with the cream has made my skin softer and more supple feeling. I like quite a few things in the Dr. Jart+ line, but this is one of my favorites.",1
"I am 72 years old and my skin has held out pretty well, but I have not taken as good a care of it as I should have. Now I am seeing small, fine wrinkles on my cheeks and it was very upsetting to me. Three or four days of using both these two products together, morning and night and the skin on my cheeks is smooth again. I can hardly believe it. The lines above my upper lip and around my eyes are far less noticeable and not as deep. I will die with this on my face.",1
"Love this! I use it on my face, neck and hands. It is great as a hand treatment, my hands look much better after using this for a week. The liquid absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin feeling smooth, soft and plump. This also helps to soothe inflammation and redness.",1
After reading the amazing reviews I thought this was going to be my holy grail serum along with the cream and boy was I wrong. After the first application my skin started to sting and burn but I kept using it because i really wanted it to work since I paid so much for it and it worked amazingly on my mom but instead it gave me red skin bumps ALL OVER my face and it took over a week for it to go away. I Don't recommend this for extremely dry sensitive skin,0
"I have fine lines under my eyes, and I didn't notice any visible firming at all. This feels like any other basic eye cream, and you definitely don't need to spend 80$ on this.",0
"I have skin that changes depending on the season. In the winter, it is extremely dry and irritated causing acne and breakouts. I am terrified of putting anything other than water on my skin because it is so sensitive and my pores get clogged very easily. I have been using this for a few weeks and have not broken out and have noticed my skin has become more supple. This is pricey but goes a long way. Just a dime size amount is enough for your face.",1
"If you're using acne products or taking medication for acne, you need this serum. While products and medication dry out my t-zone to acceptable levels, they make the rest of my face totally parched and this is the only thing i've found that helps with dry patches. It absorbs super quickly and a little goes a long way--I find that three drops is enough to cover my entire face and this bottle is *big*. I also have very sensitive skin and I haven't had any problems with this product at all, it's definitely become a new winter staple for me.",1
"I absolutely love this Ceramidin Liquid Lotion! I use this Ceramidin Liquid Lotion during the day and the Lotion with matching Cream layered on top at night. I have SUPER sensitive, dry skin with acne (lucky me), so finding products that work without irritation or dryness is a real challenge for me. This is perfect! Hydrates my skin with zero side effects. I even took it into my dermatologist, who read the ingredients and said it would be perfect for me. Will buy again and again.",1
"I purchased a full sizebottle of Ceramidin Liquid after trying a sample of the Ceramidin cream. My only real complaint is the fragrance -- if you has scent sensitivities, this is not for you. I'm a week into using it regularly and I notice an immediate difference. I follow up with Weleda Almond Lotion as a moisturizer. I think the Ceramidin cream felt moisturizing on it's own but with this serum, you'll need to follow up with a moisturizer. I have heard serums penetrate deeper though which is why I opted for the Liquid.",1
"Love this serum and will definitely be repurchasing it once it runs out. 5 oz for the price is an incredible deal, considering you only need 3-4 drops of this serum to make your face feel amazing. Highly suggest it to everyone, regardless of skin type(dry, oily, etc). It gives my dry, dehydrated skin life again!",1
"I have very dry cheeks and a very oily tzone, generally dull and boring skin with ruddy pigmentation. This moisturizer brings life and evenness to my face. I don't have perfect skin because of it, but it makes a BIG difference compared to the old ""sensitive skin"" drugstore moisturizers I used previously. I use it alone after washing & before sunscreen/primer, not alongside the cream. And the bottle is massive â€” I was weary to order because of the price but it's more than proved its worth.",1
Personally for me it isn't anything special. Disappointed.,1
"That's right, this product was used on many a model's face before makeup. I just had to try it for my dry skin and my daughter's eczema and so far it's really great. Its so gentle that I questioned its effectiveness but it is really good. My skin is soft and feels hydrated even the next AM.",1
"The first thing I noticed about this serum is that it's very liquidy- almost like water. I like that you get a lot of it for your money. I add this serum under my moisturizer on cold days. So far, I've liked it- it hasn't made me break out, and I'll take all the moisture I can get. I sometimes like to add some moisturizer on top of my makeup later in the day if my skin is really dry, and I tried doing that with this. It didn't mesh well with my makeup, so I'll stick to using it under moisturizer/makeup.",1
I have ultra sensitive skin and had problems with slight eczema under my eyes which would make my concealer look awful. My face is completely healed and has a beautiful overall texture after using this for a month. It's SO SOFT. I use this liquid under my cetaphil moisturizer and they work together perfectly. I use a lot at night and a little bit in the morning before makeup. This is a keeper and a true skin saver,1
"Incredible moisturizer for combination skin. Reality is you get 5oz so for an incredible serum, 50 bucks is very reasonable. I'm on my second bottle. My skin feels nourished and moisturized. In the past, if I didnt moisturize at night, my skin would be dry, it was the products I was using. Now my skin is stronger, healthier, less breakouts, glowing. I can't say enough about this product. I just wish it was in the stores but oh well. I would like to try the cream next for our brutal Canadian winters. Def try this product!!!",1
This is a wonderful product that truly brings the moisture without the heavy feeling. I wish it was more affordable but it's def a must have especially during the winter seasons.,1
Huge bottle and love how it feels under the ceramidin cream!,1
"Cheap, a lot in one bottle, safe for my sensitive skin.I use a very generous amount right after washing my face and neck and even down to chest area. It smells kinda funny, but nothing significantly bothering. It is just a very gentle light moisturizer before applying heavier cream.Alone itself, I still feel my skin needs more hydration tho.",1
"I love the cream version, but I really just can't see that this liquid did anything at all for my dry skin. Mine wasn't thick or rich like others have said, mine was very watery and didn't even feel moisturizing upon initial application. It just felt like...well...water? I'll definitely continue to use the cream but for me this liquid isn't worth the extra step (even though it is nicely priced).",0
I really wanted to like it because I have super sensitive acne-prone skin. But it really did nothing on my face but make it super oily. So I gave it to a friend.,0
I love this cleanser! Any products takes two weeks to show real results and this one did indeed. Word to the wise: it did make me break out for those first two weeks... almost as if it was removing all the impurities from my skin. However my skin has not experienced any break outs since. I have combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry cheeks. A must for anyone having issues with minor acne! Leaves my skin extra clean.,1
"I guess i'm in the minority here, but I hated this product. It broke me out! I had little bumps all over my cheeks. I hated the consistency. I have oily/combo skin and this definitely did not provide any moisturization for me, it actually felt sticky on my skin. I can't imagine how someone with dry skin would like this. I'm a bit surprised at all the glowing reviews, wondering if I got a dud. I will be returning this for something more moisturizing.",0
"My facialist pushes the hyaluronic acid; my dermatologist pushes the ceramides. Ceramidia packs a bunch of both, and at a realistic price! I have extremely oily but dehydrated skin with large poors and rosacea; I have to be really careful about what I use. I've been trying Cerave PM with a pump of hyaluronic acid, but it didn't seem to be enough. I use about 1/4 tsp of Ceramidia at night and I'm wayyyyy happy. It's a generous bottle, too. I'm hoping that just because it will be awhile between purchases, Sephora won't think I've lost interest and discontinue the product.",1
Had a dry patch on my chin...this stuff took care of it,1
Nice moisturiztion lotion. Not heavy but stay longer.,1
smooth and give instant hydration!,1
"I got this as a sample with the cream. They're supposed to work together, but I don't care for the cream as it's a bit too heavy for me, but this stuff is amazing. I use it after my standard serum and it adds piles of moisture to my face without feeling gloppy or heavy. The bottle is huge, too! Lasts forever.",1
"I don't know what took me so long to buy this, but this is a miracle in a bottle for those of us with dry skin. I don't have many thing I call Holy Grail, but this is definitely #1 in my list of must haves.",1
this is the best serum i have ever used............the best!! i saw results overnight! it made my face look so fresh and radiant and after 9 hours at work my face still looks so fresh and so clean. i have never used the words HG until now. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this product is taking me to VIB rouge as i will be buying it for my mom and sisters too. lol,1
"I haven't actually bought this yet but I most definitely will. I received a sample at the Sephora in my city. I asked for something moisturizing but not oily or greasy and that's exactly how this product is not. It's non-greasy, non-oily and still moisturizing. My T-Zone is oily and my the rest of my face gets dry. I also love this product because you only need a little bit and the bottle is a very decent size. I could stretch it for months, maybe even a year. This is a must-have.",1
Great product! I use this before any product. The first day I used it I noticed a glow. I am on week 2 and noticed less blackheads as well.,1
"Love love this serum. It is thick and creamy and moisturized. As it suggested, I use the serum before the cream. My skin glows all day.",1
This product works just like the description says and you get 5 oz. for $39. Need I say more?,1
"This is my daily base layer of protection and moisture. I have very sensitive skin that is also prone to dryness, and this Ceramidin really makes a difference day-to-day. I highly recommend! I use this in conjunction with Ceramidin Cream, mixed with an SPF50 facial sunblock, and a BB Cream. Since I've started using all of the Ceramidin products I've had noticeably less dryness and also less oiliness due to the moisture being balance in my skin. I highly recommend all of the Dr. Jart+ products!",1
"This is probably the best skincare item I have ever used. I actually genuinely see results. I have combination type skin; oily on my T-zone, and dry on the rest. This product moisturizes my skin while completely evening my skin tone. I don't even need to wear foundation or tinted moisturizer anymore. The texture of the product was surprising because it wasn't what I was expecting. It's very light liquidy substance and I was expecting more of a thick gel. That said, it still feels great. If you're even considering buying this product, I highly recommend it.",1
"Suffering from dry skin and allergies, I want a product that contains no parabens or petroleum [like the muck my GP prescribed] that actually works. I have had to slather my face in oil after getting out the shower for relief. This stuff has immediately improved my skin. I wish I had bought the cream at the same time.",1
"This works as a Booster Serum, it goes on after your toner or any treatment with requires you to use a cotton pad.This is helped my de-hydrated skin from all the acne treatments. My skin always feel fresh and looks much better when i use this booster serum.",1
"I used this moisturizer on a daily basis both in the morning and the evenings. I have been using it for a month now so far no break outs. I like the fact that it is liquid, definitely feels light weight and soft. I recommend.",1
"I love it , and I didn't know I would! I used with the wrinkle warrior and together under my smashbox foundation it is a dream!!!! I don't like the fragrance but that's ok. My dry skin soaked it up and it hasn't broken me out",1
"Save yourself $90.00 and invest in a different moisturizer. If you are hoping to purchase a moisturizer that will offer you visible improvements in your skin, this one disappointed me. After 3 months of use I see no difference.",0
It is very moisturizing but does not feel heavy orgreaser. I don't have wrinkles but I have quite a fewfine lines. My skin feels and looks better every time I useit. Also love the way it dispenses the lotion.,1
"I'm getting fine lines and decided to up my skincare game to the max. Get this I did my research and this product is backed by a Nobel Prize anti-aging breakthrough and also the cheapest in the Prize winners so it's a no brainier for me. It doesn't smell the best but it's not discussing and I can tolerate it because it's the best. I use the serum, eye cream and this moisturizer and my skin looks amazing. When people find out how old I really am which is only when they ask for my ID (strange at my age to me) they say wow no way what's your secret? I say skincare is and should be your major splurge besides foundation. These items are put all over your face so they should be the best! Other items can be skimped on because most major makeup brands are owned by the same company as the drugstore brands. Research is key to good skin as well. I do use an exfoliant, sometimes a peel, hyaluronic acid and C but those items can be found in lower priced products in high amounts.",1
"I have been using this for about a month and I love it. It is very moisturizing and hydrating on my combination skin. I love how it feels in the morning when I wake up - still clean and not oily (since I go straight to the gym without washing my face). I will continue to use this as long as it keeps my skin feeling soft, moisturized, and clean.",1
"Although this is an anti aging product, I would recommend to people who are looking for an amazing moisturizer alone. This moisturizer is truly amazing. I have extremely dry skin and eczema and this product is by far the best I've used. It leaves your skin feeling like silk. And the anti aging never hurts either! (I'm 17 lol)",1
"I was looking for a great moisturizer to put on daily and I had the hardest time finding a cream that worked for everyday. I finally tried this and it was magic. This, combined with the Exfolikate cleanser is the best combo ever on the planet. It is never oily, just absorbs immediately and your skin is crazy soft.",1
"Doesn't leave me feeling greasy, good consistency, but isn't worth the price. I see no difference in my skin after using this for 2 months. I purchased it based on a recommendation from a friend who raved about it, but I don't think it does anything for me at all. Won't purchase again (especially because there are some amazing brands at a lower price point that can do the same thing) I also don't think it moisturizes that well.",0
Not worth the $ in my opinion. I think it broke me out. I really didn't like the scent. I also didn't see any great results.,0
"I wouldn't consider myself as having sensitive skin, nor the type to review a product. Tried this on a recommendation from a super friendly and seemingly knowledgable employee. This broke me out like crazy. I couldn't figure out why I was getting little pimples on my face. Started to apply in certain areas, the other areas cleared up. Super disappointed. Don't spend good money on this. Did not do anything for my fine lines AND it broke me out. Two thumbs down.",0
"I have always been satisfied with the sephora staff recommendations but on my last visit a representative from Kate Somerville was in sephora and really pressured me to try it. They stood in front of the brand I usually purchase so I thought it can't be that much different than my usual brand and it cost less. Does NOT provide moisturizing,or lessen dark spots. I could get past the smell but my nose has been peeling badly using this cream. If I did not live so far from a sephora I would return it. I have used different high end moisturizing creams some I like better than others. I don't usually write reviews but a product this costly should be better.",0
I use this just at night to make it last longer and still see nice results. I do hate the price tag but after trying to go without it I'm back buying it again. It's the perfect consistency and I love it.,1
I used my first jar and was very happy with it but decided to try something else when it was gone. BIG mistake! This product moisturizes without being greasy and works well on my sensitive skin. I will be sticking with this one going forward.,1
"No breakouts, no reactions...my skin is hydrated and smooth, and people have a hard time believing my age. I also use the eye cream, Vit C Serum, and retinol. I never thought I needed a moisturizer (having always had oily skin), but this is my holy grail.",1
"This cream is amazing. I've been using it for about two years now. It's not too greasy and doesn't upset my very sensitive skin. It gives just the right amount of hydration for my dry skin. It is however, pricey. The one time I did not repurchase this after I ran out I regretted it immediately. Tried several other cheaper products with terrible results. You get what you pay for. This is the good stuff!!",1
"This is the nicest anti-aging cream I have ever tried. I HATE that is costs $90 for 1.7 oz!!, but it's still the best cream I have tried. It makes my skin glow. I don't wear any foundation, and I like the way my face looks after using this cream. The drawbacks, aside from the cost, are that you can't tell when you are running out until you have run out because you can't see inside the jar. I have taken it apart, but after you do that it doesn't dispense correctly. I use it underneath KS RetAsphere with retinol every few days, which is also $85 for 1 oz. I hate paying that price for such a tiny amount of product, but they are the only cosmetics I pay lots of money for, so that's my excuse. I would advise someone to try this cream, as it works and feels great on my skin. I am only giving it 4 stars because of the price. The product itself is 5 star!.",1
"I really wanted to love this, but I just couldn't get past the first two days. This product broke my skin almost immediately. I have extremely sensitive skin that is also dry, and a Sephora staff member recommended this. I would not recommend it to anyone with similar skin as myself. I returned it for a refund.",0
"Absolutely amazing moisturizer. I am currently using a sample of this and it's the most hydrating moisturizer I've ever used without feeling super sticky, too thick, or shiny. This cream absorbs quickly but lives your skin feeling soft, nourished, and it locks in the moisture!",1
"Tried the sample. My forehead is now awash in bumpiness, which has never been my issue. Thank goodness for the other reviewer who indicated her sensitive skin's reaction. My skin is sensitive, but? I've tried and used lots of products on it successfully. Alas.",0
"For $90.00, this should have worked better. The gal who sold me in it said it was THE BEST product for dark spots...WRONG! Not only did it not work, I ran out in a little over a month! I used 1 pump each time, so it's not like I was using to much. It also doesn't have an spf in it. I took the pump apart to see if I could scrape anymore out (you don't know your low until it's gone because there's no way to see inside), and the actual part that contains the moisturizer is much smaller than packaging! The outside is very deceiving! Bottom line, if your gonna spend $90 on a moisturizer, don't buy this one!",0
"I tried a sample of this simply because I had run out of my Clinique moisterizer and I didn't baby time to get some more. Within three days my skin was glowing. I didn't have any blemishes, my oily skin somewhat repaired itsslelf, and my skin was flawless. This is truly a miracle in a bottle. It's worth the price I promise you!",1
"I had been searching for an anti aging cream that I could fall in love with. This is it. I use it morning an evening under the KS line release serum. Together they are dynamite. I just turned 50,and my skin is good. No major issues. Believe me this cream is worth the investment. I'm a fan for life!. Thank you KS, your products rock my socks!",1
"I just recently entered the high-end skin care world and did a lot pf research regarding ingredients before doing so. This moisturizer has a great list of beneficial ingredients and did wonders for my tired, pale, stressed skin, although I should note that I also used a serum, most recently Quench also by KS, and I expect that helped as well. My one issue with this cream is that it has a lot of fruit extracts and fragrant oils in it, and I am concerned about putting so many of such things on my face, but they don't seem to bother my skin. In fact, I recently tried something else that did not have those ingredients and while it is okay, it is not nearly as moisturizing, so I will probably go right back to Age Arrest.",1
"This is a wonderful product. I ran out and got a sample of this cream after reading about it on a beauty blog. After using it for 3 days, i knew I couldn't go without it and purchased it. I mix this with three drops of the Nude Skincare Progenius oil morning and night and my skin has never been happier.",1
The best! I've tried a lot and keep coming back to this product. Heavier than her other daily moisturizers.,1
"I bought this following an in-store demonstration. I should have stuck with my instincts that this was not maybe the best ""moisturizer"" for me when the rep said they suggest not just 1 serum before application but 2, so a pre-serum then a serum. Seriously. Within 24 hrs I could tell I felt dryer than usual and within 48 my forehead was flakey, a problem I hadn't for 25 years. Then to make matters worse it caused mild breakouts in my chin and nose area. I used the product for only two days and two weeks later things are just settling down.",0
"I tried it for a few days but the ingredients caused redness. I have fair, sensitive skin. I will continue using their regular daily moisturizer though.",1
"I have been using this cream for about a year now and I absolutely love it! I am in my 30s, and about a year ago I started noticing that my skin was becoming more dehydrated, tired looking and I was developing fine lines. No matter what moisturizers I tried nothing seemed to help. So I headed to sephora and picked this up after one of the staff members recommended it. I truly feel like this has made a huge difference in my skin! I am sensitive/acne/combo and this cream has not irritated my face. It has just made my skin look more youthful, soft and smooth. I apply a thin layer all over my face and neck and I found that a little goes a long way. (I will use less or more depending on how my skin is acting that day but I usually never use more than 1/2 - 3/4 of a pump.) I highly recommend this cream for anyone starting to see the signs of aging, it will definitely take a few years off of your skin :)",1
"I love the way my face feels after using this, plus makeup goes on great just a few minutes later. It has also helped my daughter who is a type 1 diabetic and has very sensitive, dry skin.",1
"this product is lightweight and feels nice. however, i didn't notice a difference in my skin at all. when i read the ingredients, it contained lavender extract, which can cause irritation on sensitive skin. for this price, i'll stick to one without the irritants",1
"I have sensitive skin and tend to react to some of Kate's products, as well as a litany of others. I sampled this and was surprised to discover it does not react with my skin. Most importantly, it really works! I noticed an immediate improvement in texture and fullness that seems to have persisted. I use it as a moisturizer at night after cleansing and with a serum. Nights when I don't use it I definitely notice a difference the next morning. Highly recommended,",1
"This cream has a great feel and light scent and works well for me. I've noticed how easily and smoothly my make-up goes on and how pretty my skin looks since using it. I have light skin, combinations-type skin. No breakouts at all. I love it!",1
They product goes on sooo smoothly and there is a lot of product in the container. Your skin feels more soft right away and brightens up after a week. Great!,1
Totally inlove with this cream! I have super sensitive skin and unfortunately many creams dry out my skin or irritate it but not this one.... It instantly hydrated and softened my skin and absolutely NO burning like most products that I've tried and believe me I have tried them all! It left my face with the most beautiful glow and looks absolutely flawless under my foundation... Took care of my dry patches making applying makeup enjoyable again. Feels so wonderful on my skin.... Truly my hg I will never be without! Thank you for making such a fabulous cream!!!,1
"I would break out a lot, but once I began to use this product a long with the moisturizer, and etc my skin has been looking better than ever. I receive a lot of compliments from people and i find myself to be wearing less foundation now because of how good my skin looks.",1
"What an awful disappointed this cream is. I bought it believing that their statement ""this product is clinically tested to be safe for sensitive skin"" was actually true. This product caused nasty breakouts around my chin and jaw area. It has been over 2 weeks since I stopped using the cream and the breakouts have not yet fully cleared. Do not waste your money if you have sensitive skin!",0
Not heavy . Luv itNo wrinkles and prevents them I use the face cream and apply to my neck and the eye cream as well,1
"Since I have only been using this product for the past 2 weeks, I really can only speak to 1 aspect of what the product is supposed to do. This Age Arrest Anti-Wrinkle Cream is extremely hydrating. It makes my skin soft and supple. With some other creams, I get this greasy sheen on my face, but this product absorbs well (but not necessarily quickly - give it 5 minutes) and hydrates enough to noticeably reduce the amount of oil production on my face. (When my oily/combination skin is dry, it overproduces oil.) It has an interesting scent, not unpleasant, but one that you get used to. Not the typical floral scent of some other high-end lines. Aside from hydration and decreased oil production, I noticed that I had less breakouts. I typically get the occasional clogged pore a couple times a month and hormonal acne on my chin. My skin had an even tone as well. The product is dispensed in this squeeze canister that I prefer to a jar where I have to scoop out what I use daily. I use maybe 3/4 of a pump on my face. I guess we'll see about the Age Arrest Anti-Wrinkle part of the cream!",1
"Complete an utter waste of money, One of the worst anti aging creams i have ever used. It is pure junk. it made my skin so lifeless, gray , dull and just horrid....DON'T BUY.",0
"I've been using this cream for about 2 months now and I can honestly say it works. I bought this to prevent the natural aging process. Having just turned 30, I'd like to keep a youthful appearance lol. I use this after washing my face along with the moisture serum. It absorbs quickly despite being heavy. It leaves my face instantly soft and radiant. I also apply it on my neck, and it is here where I have seen interesting results. Before using this the skin on my neck felt goose-bumpy and sort of raised, if that makes any sense. But now, it is smooth when I touch it. I was pretty amazed. My face looks and feels just as smooth too. I will buy this again when I finish it.",1
"I have been using this along with the age arrest eye cream for over a month abc do am very impressed... I have very sensitive skin and was a bit hesitant Because some of her other products were too intense for me, but this has done wonders! My face feels softer and tighter and it works amazing underneath my makeup, also I don't think it works well as preventative skin care.... I don't think it wouldn't work well on younger skin!! Love love love this stuff!",1
I have a habit of trying different moisturizers every month because Im never satisfied but this one is a keeper looks like I found the one,1
"I went into Sephora to find a makeup foundation. After cleansing my face the Sephora makeup artist applied Kate Somervile Age Arrest Cream. This cream is so luxurious, light weight and moisturising. The flakey dry areas of my face disappeared imediately and my skin glowed. I love this product. I have tried many face creams over the years with so so results. Age Arrest is a keeper. The pump on the jar keeps the product clean, fresh and free of contamination.",1
Thick and creamy. Not greasy. Absorbs and leaves my skin feeling great!! Defiantly will keep using this product.,1
"Excellent crÃ¨me. TrÃ¨s peu parfumÃ©e. J'utilise cette crÃ¨me depuis 2 mois et je suis trÃ¨s satisfaite. Ma peau Ã©tait dÃ©shydratÃ©e et aprÃ¨s 3 semaines d'utilisation, ma peau Ã©tait vraiment belle et douce!J'utilisais avant Bliss Triple Oxygen mais elle ne rÃ©pondait plus Ã  mes besoins. Cette crÃ¨me est dispendieuse mais je vais en racheter.",1
"I've been using Age Arrest for about a month, morning and evening. From the moment I opened it, I've loved the scent. The push dispenser/top is pretty cool too. Immediately I noticed how soft and moisturized my skin was. I got this cream in the middle of January, so my skin was not happy, but this changed all that. I didn't notice an immediate difference with my wrinkles, but after about 3 weeks I did. Now, this isn't botox (or what I would imagine botox to be), but it does the trick for me right now! I will buy this product again!",1
"I was talked into buying it by the rep along with a few other things. I returned those but kept this one. It's actually really good and I'm noticing a difference in my complexion when I apply my make-up. My skin looks really good, glowing, and smaller pores. (I have medium pores, oily skin, and spend way too much on finding good products.). The exfolikate was really good too but I have so many similar products for less price point.",1
"I was convinced into buying this cream by a sales associate at a Sephora store and it was horrible. I bought it on Thursday afternoon, used it that night and the following morning and 24 hours later my skin was peeling off my face! I had been told it was for sensitive skin and I could even apply it around my eyes! Good thing I didn't listen!To top it off, when I went to return it two days later, a different sales associate spoke down to me as if was my fault for buying a cream that wasn't meant for ""young skin."" I couldn't even believe it!",0
"I really like this product. I was using Clinique and it was just not doing it for me, especially in this cold Chicago weather. I tried this and it does feel ""tight"" afterward (almost ""squeaky clean) but with the softening toner afterward, it feels great. I then use the night cream with it and man! You can tell the difference in my skin! I also don't know what everyone is talking about when they say the smell is strong?? Never really noticed that.",1
"I have combo skin, not sensitive nor dry. I generally want to like Shiseido since it was the first brand I ever used (I enjoy some of their serums/moisturizers), but this was too intense as a cleanser. It's foamy and lathers well but it claims that it's ""gentle""... it actually strips the moisture from your skin.",0
"I've been going to the KS clinic before Kate even had a product line and the results there are amazing!!! That said, I've always been very selective about purchasing KS products because I find other brands to be more effective for my skin. Other than Age Arrest, I use the KS Detox Cleanser and Clearing Mask. I have combo/ very oily T zone which is hormonally triggered. I found Age Arrest to be too heavy for my skin after about a week so discovering that it works around my eyes has been wonderful. I have been using this cream for almost 4 weeks now and I can say I've seen a remarkable improvement in hydration and crepiness under my eyes. I find that the less expensive more natural products that I prefer just don't cut it for me in the eye area, so I was thrilled to start using this just around the eyes! I use half a pump and dot it around my eyes: including the brow bone area, corners and underneath. I'd go easy on the upper eye/lid/brow bone just in case you have some sensitivity but I found I don't get any irritation whatsoever. LOVE this stuff for the eyes!",1
Although I have just started using this cream I love the thickness of it and how easily it is absorbed. And not a drop of cream is wasted thanks to the unique dispenser.,1
"I like this product its not greasy going on , I have combination skin but some creams make my skin feel yucky and greasy, not a look or feel Im going for. Nice scent feels nice going on , and not heavy. No parabens in this Kate Somervile product. Some of her products do contain Parabens.... I wont by them if they contain Parabens. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.",1
My skin was looking a little aged from working outside in the sun this summer so Idecided to give this a try. My nose and chin were looking really dark but this seemed to even out the color and smoothed the texture of my skin. The only thing I didn't care for was it left my skin feeling a little greasy towards the end of a hot summer day working in the sun. I'll keep using it at night untill the weather cools off to use during the day.,1
I double cleanse using Tatcha's Cleansing oil followed by this. It is so foamy and the smallest amount goes a long way! This leaves my skin feeling super clean but not stripped. I also love how it smells. Will definitely be repurchasing.,1
"I really love this cleanser. It's super gentle on my dryish skin and a little goes a LONG way - all you need it a half pea size amount to lather across your whole face. It's not a makeup removing cleanser though, so just make sure to take your makeup off first.",1
"Been using this for over 2yrs and love it!! It's so gentle on my dry cheeks, but cleanses my oily t-zone! Amazing!",1
I bought this because the reviews looked good and it claimed to be a moisturizing cleanser which is what I look for in cleansers. I have breakouts and I used this before I went to bed and woke up with my acne looking smaller healed and my skin looking even and smooth. A huge difference in just one night so I'm impressed! Plus it didn't leave my skin tight and flaky! 5/5 I will buy this again if it continues to improve my skin with every use,1
This is the one product that helped me with my breakout. It is gentle enough to clean my skin. I have been using this one for years and will not change anytime soon!!!,1
This cleanser makes my skin so smooth and it is very gentle and creamy. Highly suggest for anyone with sensitive skin!,1
"I've been struggling with adult acne for years, and coming up on 30... it's not been pretty. My career demands that I have a flawless complexion, and being considered ""older"" in my industry, I also have to look 21 again. The struggle is real. But not only did this cleanser clear my skin, but it's made my skin look and feel like it did in my early 20s! I fool designers all the time now! Love this product!!! I will be a life long customer of SHISEIDO! The IBUKI Line is FANTASTIC! 5 stars all day!",1
By far one of the BEST cleanser I've ever tried!,1
"A little goes a long way, feels really nice on the face, works well with a luna, leaves skin feeling silky smooth. On the down side I feel like it dries a little sticky. I don't know if it is a positive or a negative but it leaves my face extremely shiny.",1
"My skin is super sensitive and acne-prone and it has taken me a long time to figure out what it likes and more importantly, what it doesn't like. I've tried dozens of cleaners and this one has definitely left an impression. It makes your skin feel squeaky clean, but doesn't leave it feeling tight and dry. Though my adult acne hasn't completely gone away, there is definitely an improvement and I truly believe this cleanser has helped. I've repurchased at least 4 times",1
"I did not start to take care of my skin daily till I turned 26. I have always had fair skin and no real issues. But last year, I started to break out and I notice my skin was just all over the place. It was dry and then oily and then dry again. I went multiple drug brands and brand names... but this one gave me the best feeling on my face. I love it. My face feels really clean afterwards. It gives me a refresh feeling after a long day. Love this cleanser!",1
I have oily skin but this products makes my skin feels dry and tight even though it is supposed to be gentle. It doesn't cleanse very well. I still have a lot of makeup residue left on my face.,0
"Really love this stuff. I use it after my makeup removing wash. It leaves my face clean, but doesn't dry it out. I have very weird skin.. combo-oily dry--also breaks out from time to time but my skin seems to like this. It cleans my face and leaves it fresh and I love the smell. I will be buying more of this when I run out!",1
My favourite face wash and the only one I use! Makes your skin feel baby soft! Worth the price and goes a LONG way! I only use a pea size amount as it lathers really really well! Must buy!,1
"I really love the products I've tried from the Ibuki line, including this cleanser, which I got in a 30 ml. trial size. It is gentle but effective and the tiniest amount yields a luxurious creamy foam that also smells divine. Can't wait to purchase the full size.",1
"I have oily skin which may have become worse when I started using products targeted for oily skin, I am not sure. I like this product but I do not see how it can be so ""gentle"" when the exfoliations beads in it are quite hard and abundant in the formula. I do not feel using this everyday is good for my skin and may make it more oily. I did not notice a huge difference in my skin using this cleanser compared to any other one I've used, however maybe it is good as a exfoliator used only once or twice a week.",1
Such a great product. Removes dirt and makeup. A little goes a long way!,1
I liked it at first despite the off-putting soap smell and the fact that it left my skin kind of tight after cleansing. Then I noticed that my toner was taking off a lot of face makeup residue that the cleanser did not remove.,1
"I have oily/combo acne prone skin and this is the BEST cleanser for removing day makeup! It's SOO gentle and smooth! A tiny pea sized amount will later richly with wet hands and face into a creamy foam! I love thick lather! It doesn't have any noticeable scent, and it doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever. It leaves your skin super fresh and squeaky clean. This tube lasts a LONG time too so it's totally worth it and easy to transfer into a travel compact if you need some on the go. The only little problem I had is that it doesn't efficiently remove all of the mascara I use so I apply eye makeup remover before cleansing. Also there are some ingredients that might irritate some people, so it's gentle to slim extent. I give it 4 stars because of that.",1
It foams great and doesn't burn my eyes. My skin is very sensitive and I don't have any issues. I use this with a clarisonic. It's a great value for the size.,1
"I recently bought a clarisonic and was running out of their trial size cleanser. I wanted something gentle, but still high quality. I was in Sephora and the description fit my needs so I gave it a try. I LOVE it, the light foam feels so nice and works great with my clarisonic. As soon as I rinse my skin feels so clean. LOVE and would definitely purchase again - although I think I'll continue to try other products just for fun!",1
I usually get random patches of dry skin after my nightly face wash but ever since I started using this.. Omg. I can't stop patting my face afterwards. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and the gentle cleanse really makes me feel refreshed.,1
Great face wash and make up remover! Use a small amount. This product lasts for long periods of time.,1
"My skin is sensitive, dry and prone to break outs. When a sales associate recommended this product I was scared to use it but after 3 weeks it has been nothing but great for my skin. No break outs and it has made my skin go back to normal. One thing I don't like is that it isn't fragrant free but I'm used to it now. FYI a little goes a long way and it removes all my make up even eye makeup.",1
I still cant tell if it works. Defently doesnt remove my makeup smells wierd if i have foundation and its just mehh,1
"I just started using this stuff a couple of weeks ago. I went in looking for a cleaner that would foam with my Clarasonic ,and that would be gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Normally my skin is pretty clear. I may have a small cluster here or there ,but nothing since this product. I tried to figure out if it was something I ate or what. I am convinced it is this cleanser. I have now broken out on my entire face. I do not recommend this product to anyone.",0
"I had been using the LancÃ´me Pure Gel focus and it had been working pretty well without causing me redness or flaking but I wanted something a tad stronger to help clear my large pores and help prevent the occasions forehead blemish. This foamed twice as much as the LancÃ´me with my clarisonic and didn't make my skin feel too tight however my nose and around my mouth began to become red and flake. Tried to use it every other day at night but my skin was still reacting too much to it, even with my Origins moisturizer. I will be switching it for my LancÃ´me again.",0
Love this! I have very sensitive skin. This cleans all my makeup off easily without irritating my skin. A little dab goes a long way. Will purchase again,1
"I have very, very sensitive skin...almost anything makes me break out. I received a sample of this cleanser at the beginning of May and for some reason decided to try it (I usually don't even bother trying new things because my skin is so so picky). ",1
I have sensitive skin - love this cleanser - just a little bit and it foams up nicely and makes my face squeaky clean.,1
Experience:,1
Pro- Only need the smallest amount to cover your face.,0
I buy this product regularly. My face is pretty sensitive and this does not irritate it at all. It also lathers up well so a little goes a long way.,1
"I love how this product feels on my skin - light, creamy and it smells lovely. I noticed almost immediately that my pores were clearer than ever before. I haven't had a breakout (fingers crossed!) since I started using it one month ago. Highly recommend and love the price tag!",1
"This turn out to be a huge disappointment, shiseido's stuff are usually quite mild and hydrating I'm basing this on Japanese lines that's more targeted towards asian market ), but I find this cleanser incredibly drying and not effective at all, can't even wash off the foundation stain on the bottle after several tries.",0
This cleanser works the best with my sensitive combination skin. It takes off absolutely all the makeup without drying out my face. Been using it for years now. Huge love!,1
"I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks now and love it. My skin tends to be dry and sensitive. This cleanser hydrates, cleans deep and I haven't had any negative reactions. It's so gentle, I love how it makes my skin feel! Also -- it smells so amazing. Definitely recommend!",1
"I use this product twice a day with my clarisonic. I feel that immediately after drying my face, that my face is clean, hydrated and radiant. It does have a ""squeaky"" sensation but it is nothing that I am concerned about. This product is great for people who have taken Accutane or had facial lasers done. It is gentle but works wonders.",1
"I love how this face wash is great for sensitive skin. It is exactly as it claims - gentle. I like to try skin care products, ALOT.. But I always go back to the Ibuki line, especially this wash.. Because it is the only line that does not give me bad skin reactions!",1
"This is an amazing cleanser. For some reason my skin reacts so quickly to cleansers. If I switch to various cleansers, my skin will either like it or break out immediately. This and my L'occittane Shea cleansing oil are both ride or die. A tiny pea sized is all I use, with my clairsonic and it removes all makeup and leaves my face soft and not dry. Kind of smells old lady-ish, but its such a great cleanser I'm willing to overlook. It lathers up beautifully and feels very luxurious on the skin.",1
"This is just what my sensitive skin needed! It does not make me break out and keeps overall skin redness at bay. It keeps my skin in perfect balance, which is a must or my skin issues.",1
This cleanser is so gentle yet so effective it removes makeup and leaves my skin feeling very soft. My skin is the oiliest skin you can find and still works wonders on it im also very acne prone. Hands down the best cleanser out there,1
"My skin is dry, but also prone to breakouts. I love how well just a tiny pea sized amount works so well to remove dirt, oil, makeup etc to keep those breakouts at bay. Highly recommend this one and also the regular gentle cleanser (less drying), the beneficence (added moisture) and the future solutions cleanser (ultimate splurge for all skin types).",1
"After months ago I used Clarisonic Mia 2 my skin got really really dried out. I got pretty bad break outs and my skin was out of control. Before my skin was pretty much flawless, perhaps had a break out once every few months, and I had nice and soft skin . So .. During the winter my skin got even drier especially that Clarisonic did quite a damage to my skin , went to Sephora for some skincare regimen shopping because that's the only thing that could help me. Decided to try out this cleanser a long with some other products . I wanted something gentle after I'd use my Tatcha Camelia Oil to get rid of make up that is usually set deeper within skin and to help with break outs. It seems to work pretty great, my skin is brighter, even toned, less break outs, softer skin, gets rid of sebum and oil , although I gotta say it does dry me out a little bit , but nothing to the point of dry patches, just simply tighter skin ? I don't know how to describe it. Anyway, I definitely recommend it . Also , it last a very very long time. I have have been using it for 3,5 months and have been using it pretty much everyday and I still got 1/3 of the product left. A bit goes a long way ! Overall a pretty amazing cleanser ! :)",1
"This is a great cleanser if you have a sensitive skin that reacts to harsh chemicals in cleansers. The texture is thick gel-like, and a pleasant grandmother scent. I use one and a half to two pea-sized amounts each time I use this product - it lasts about 5 months, which is definitely on the economic side. I wish that the Ibuki cleanser was a bit more potent, because it does not remove my (waterproof) sunscreen or (waterproof) eyebrow gel efficiently. Also I sometimes have minor breakouts due to some of the sunscreen not being removed entirely. These are the only cons in my opinion. I rated it 5/5, because it is closer to 5 stars than 4 stars.",1
I bought several skin care items through Sephora at the beginning of January. This and the rice enzyme powder thing by tatcha were the only things that didn't break me out and I've kept using through February.,1
My skin recently started changing and was prone to constant break outs on my T zone and wouldn't go away for weeks! I seen this product and decided to give it a try with each wash my break out started vanishing leaving my skin soft and back to be healthy. This face wash makes me want to want my face over and over and takes off makeup good as well. It's worth every penny and a little goes a long way! I recommend this to anyone whose skin is starting to change with their age. I won't use anything else!,1
Bought this product and I like it it works better than the clairosonic it makes more foam and goes a long way doesn't leave my skin dry . I have dry skin and it's been working great goes a long way .,1
Bought this face wash for my boyfriend and myself. He's prone to breakouts and I have sensitive skin. This face wash worked great on both of us. Leaves skin so soft and clean. Loved this product!,1
"This face wash is the only one I've ever found that I can use daily without breaking out. It's incredibly gentle and can be worked into a nice, thick lather that always leaves me feeling incredibly clean and doesn't dry my skin out. I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.",1
I tried this as a sample and instantly feel in love with this cleanser. My skin is extremely sensitive and I often breakout with cleanser's claim to be hypoallergenic and/or for sensitive skin. I have not had a rash it broken out at all from this cleanser. My skin seems to be better than ever. A small drop goes a long way and feels creamy and luxurious. This sample was a game changer for me and I am definitely going to buy the full size cleanser and anything else that they offer with this line. I highly recommend it.,1
"I have used multiple cleansers from Shiseido - the Ibuki Gentle Cleanser is my favorite.I use this product 1-2 times per day. This is best used in the shower, lathered up, left on your face for 3+ minutes, then washed off. If you wear heavy amounts of make up, you will need to repeat this process two times with heavy scrubbing at time of removal.This is a cleanser, not a direct make up removal solution (though it does work).",1
Pro: Value...Only a pea size amount is all you need to create a nice lather.,0
I have been using this cleanser for about a year now. Any time I try something new I always come back to this one. It's super gentle on my sensitive skin (I have rosacea) and I love the foamy lather it creates. Definitely one of my favorites!,1
I bought this cleanser because using anything else regularly was causing me to breakout and I was dealing with terrible blackheads on my nose. I had run out of my Shiseido cleanser for about a month and decided to try their IBUKI formula.My skin was a real mess before I tried this product and I have to say it's made a huge difference. It got rid of my blackheads and brightened by skin tone. Amazing!Love that there are no Parabens and Sulfates. Chose this product for that reason as I don't want to expose my child or myself to harmful chemicals. Definitely worth purchasing and will purchase again!,1
"This cleanser is very foamy and does a great job at cleaning the face. I also like how it smells. However, I don't like how taut it make your skin feel after rinsing. It makes your face more squeaky clean than smooth clean.",1
I received the sample size and loved it. decided to purchase the full size. I like it but not as much as the sample one. It still does the job so I will use the whole tube. But feel like the sample worked better. Use it with Clarisonic. It makes my skin squeaky clean but not drying,1
"A pea size is all you need and this thing lathers like crazy! I have oily skin, and this tends to make me feel a tiny bit dry and a little tight, but it works great! I like using this in the morning since its gentle but still very effective. I use a different cleanser at night that is more heavy duty to get off the daily grime. This cleanser is perfect for in the morning and works great with the Clarisonic!",1
This is a very foamy cleanser once you lather it. A small pea sized drop is more than enough. It effectively removes make up and my acne has been better since using it. It does dry my skin out a bit but I always follow washing my face with moisturizer anyway. My skin does seem to be less sensitive. Would buy again.,1
"I used to use the blue Pureness line from Shiseido and switched off since I started getting worried about wrinkles and wanted to find products that were more for wrinkle prevention. However, I started breaking out. I didn't want to go back to the blue line of skincare products since my face didn't feel as oily as it used to be.",1
I've been using this for a few months and it is great for my sensitive skin. I have combo skin and this does a great job of balancing. I love the way it lathers and you only need a little bit to get the job done !,1
"I have been trying and trying to find a good cleanser that would not upset my super sensitive skin, FOUND! This works great, I have less breakouts and I'm not turning red anymore either. I purchased the whole line and couldn't be happier!",1
I tried this product out and the smell was very strong. The product foamed nicely and helped cleanse away make up. It dried out my skin though and left it looking dull and a little red. I won't be using this again.,1
"This is a nice cleanser, my skin feels clean when I use this, but I feel this cleanser would be better suited for the warmer months as I find it a bit drying for the winter weather. Also, this has a heavy perfume scent which I don't like. As much as I would like to love this product, I can't. I won't be repurchasing.",1
"Good product but couldnt get past the smell. I am sure that this product is really good for the skin, it has great reviews and the brand is very established, however I couldnt get over the smell, it was like my grandmother, which is nice but not what I want to wash my face with every day. Its a great product, just not for me.",1
"I have combination skin that's pretty senstive, and most cleansers are much too drying or harsh for me. This stuff has been great. I was initially skeptical that it would work for me, as I still have hormonal breakouts and this lacks salicylic acid, but I've really come to like it. You only need a TEENY TINY bit (the bottle will seriously last you forever! I've had it for 2 months now and it barely feels less empty than the day I bought it) and it'll foam up, which is especially good for using with my Clarisonic Mia. It removes dirt and makeup, leaving my face feeling clean but not overly tight/dry (it is a little drying, but I'll only notice if I don't use any moisturizer afterwards). I'm not sure what other posters are talking about with it being exfoliating, as it's one of the creamiest cleansers I've used. There is a mild smell, but it does't really bother me. I do miss the kind of minty tingle that salicylic acid/alpha hydroxy cleansers give, but this one seems a lot nicer for my skin.",1
"Only have to use a pea size amount, foams and lathers nicely, isn't too drying and doesn't give a squeaky clean feel.",1
"This is by far the best cleansing foam I have tried. No color, no scent, very gentle, good for every skin types and very well clean. highly recommend if you are still looking for a cleanser :)",1
"I have a very hard time finding facial cleaners that do not make my skin breakout. Even skin clearing cleansers. After reading the reviews on the IBUKI Gentle Cleanser, I decided to try it. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin hasn't been this clear AND this soft in years. You only need the smallest drop for your entire face and neck. The downside is it does feel like it leaves a thin film on your skin right when you wash it. But once your face dries, your skin just feels soft and clean.",1
"I got a sample from sephora this product is a waste of time my skin felt dry, dehydrated, and itchy, I also noticed it didn't remove my makeup and it burned my skin underneath my chin it was horrible also felt like i had a lot of soap residue in my skin like a nasty film of soap scum gross will never try again!",0
I thought this was a face primer. So I bought it as such. I then realized it's part of a system. Oh well! I still use it. I put it on before my foundation and it seems to work just as well as a primer.,0
"Returned this product as it was too foaming to use with my Clarisonic, and pricks my eyes. On the plus side, a very tiny amount is needed, less than the tip of a fingernail. Even using this small amount was too foaming for me and it took too long to rinse well.",0
"I got a sample of this cleanser and really liked it, but when I bought it and used it for a few days, I found it too greasy. My combination skin obviously felt too greasy and just impure after using this product.",0
"Good cleanser, but I don't care about the scent. I'm not overly fond of this product.",0
"Finally, it turned out that this product also caused extreme redness and blotches. I wish I could give it back!",0
"This cleanser dried out my skin and caused me to break out. (Also, it did not effectively remove all my mascara - not waterproof.)",0
My face looks dull and is always red after using this product.,0
"I bought Murad Resurgence Renewing Cleansing Cream, and I guess it's for drier skin than mine. It doesn't rinse completely with water, my face doesn't feel clean after washing, and my skin shines faster than with other cleansing products I've used. It would be nice if someone came out with a regenerating cleansing product for someone with combination skin. My dry areas also need to be clean without feeling greasy.",0
"I really wanted this product to work, mainly because I was hormonally breakout. I never saw the product in action during my period because I had so many back heads and pimples that popped up around my chin that... well.. I was sad. no go for me, but may be better for others.",0
"This product was not for me. I do not want skin care samples in my play box, I want make-up samples duuh",0
i finally perfected my skin care routine until it completely broke out. i don't have sensitive skin! i did a clay mask (i have done this many times before) and then i used it and now my face has so many breakouts. i guess this is what i get to try new things lol. (it was an example in the sephora game),0
"I have no idea why you should buy it for 52 dollars. I happened to get a sample of it, and it's just a simple aloe. It's not even suitable as a ""mask"" that you put on for 10 minutes as ordered. Aloe does nice things to your skin, but you can just as easily read the ingredients and pick up a tub of the same stuff in the grocery store.",0
"I had a sample of it and recently got a proper sunburn on my face, so I thought I'd try it. It's pretty much a much more expensive version of aloe that doesn't work so well. I wouldn't buy that.",0
"My skin is usually very oily, but I use the mask when I am peeling or occasionally very dry, but when I use the mask I do not notice any difference and my skin feels the same. I feel like I am applying aloe vera to my face.",0
"I have no sensitive skin at all. I never get pimples (unless it is this time of month), but I would use this mask every time I use it, I would get a pimple every time! I returned it after two weeks of application.",0
"It has a pleasant cooling effect on the skin, but I didn't notice any real difference after washing it off. No reduction in redness, no softer skin. I think there are better masks out there for the price. I can see that this is good after sunburn or wax, but that's it.",0
"It felt good, but I feel like I might as well use aloe. It's a bit overpriced. My skin feels good afterwards, but I can get the same results with something cheaper.",0
"I have dry skin and I got a sample of this product, I tried it, but it didn't work. I really wanted to love it because I heard a lot of good things about it, but unfortunately it wasn't for me.",0
"This is the only product I've tried in the last five years that I've broken out of! Within 30 minutes of washing this product off, I got white patches on my face. Months later, I tried again and exactly the same thing happened, so I knew I had to throw it away.",0
"This mask wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't great either. I was looking for a mask that would help me hydrate and get rid of some of the redness / stains on my face. Advantages: It moisturizes and it didn't tear me out of the skin. Disadvantages: It didn't really do anything about my skin tone or remove redness. Although you get a lot of products, I couldn't justify sticking to the price. I found that it didn't give me any better results than a normal old moisturizer.",0
"I love masks and love some PTR products. Although this mask has a slight soothing effect on red / itchy / irritated areas, it doesn't seem to be moisturising or refreshing at all. I have oily skin and actually feel drier after rinsing this product. Unimpressed - there are other moisturising masks that are much more effective than this. Given the lack of results, I find the price absolutely outrageous. Save your money!",0
"I have oily skin prone to acne and got it as a deluxe sample. I found that it did not help me. I did not feel refreshed after undressing, my skin did not improve... Nevertheless, I would not buy it at all. I have the feeling that it is a more expensive aloe vera gel.",0
"Honestly, after several attempts, the product has not done much for me. I have not seen or felt any difference, especially in terms of hydration. I would not buy and I personally do not think it is worth the price.",0
"I hate to give bad reviews. I got a deluxe pattern and was able to assert several uses. My general opinion is that it didn't really do much good. It didn't irritate my skin and felt refreshing, but aloe could have the same for a fraction of the price. I don't like the product, but it's not worth buying the full size for me.",0
"Honestly, aloe vera works better. At least for me, I did not notice any change in my skin at all. However, it did not make my skin worse. I would definitely not suggest paying for it.",0
"I am a dry and sensitive skin, and this mask does nothing on my skin. The worst thing is that I cannot open my eyes.",0
"I used this product as a 10 minute mask and as a night mask, applied generously and did not see / feel any noticeable increase in hydration. I am currently suffering from very dry, flaky, seasonal skin, which also has acne outbreaks. Flakes and dryness were as common as before the application. My skin was not softer and the cool water rinse is not soothing for me.",0
"This mask does absolutely nothing other than sit on the skin. After I washed it off my skin, it looks exactly the same as before. I can't believe it because it's a $45 mask, I was expecting more, but seriously such a waste of money. Sephora's $19 mud mask is incredible.",0
"I've wanted to try this for a while, so I was happy to get a small glass in a PTR gift set when I cashed my VIB points. It felt nice and cool when I applied it, but the feeling was short-lived. After about 10 minutes, it soaked into my skin and I didn't really notice anything else. I have combination skin / dry skin and my skin didn't feel at all moisturizing or softer, just kind of tight. To be honest, it doesn't feel any different from the cucumber eel gel you apply after sunbathing, so I don't think the price is justified. I used it under my eyes because it's nice and cool, but I'm not going to buy it.",0
"It cools and moisturizes while on the skin, but does nothing immediately after washing it off. I use this week and have not noticed any long-lasting results. It would be nice for someone who enjoys a simple, relaxing mask just for fun, but does not expect any results after using it. It does not moisturize, cleanse, detoxify or soothe after washing off.",0
"After a few uses of it not thrilled, but also not disappointed. It is an okay product, but not really worth the price.",0
"Was not enthusiastic after the first use, so I am not interested. I got this as a sample and thought I would use it as a substitute for my usual mask after exfoliation. Regretted this decision, because this mask did not give any results.",0
"I bought it because I thought it would be a good light moisturising mask. It says it hydrates, but on my dry skin it's not hydrated at all. It sinks into the skin and absorbs completely after about ten minutes, leaving a tight and dry skin feeling. I'm not sure what they mean by detoxification, but I haven't noticed any difference in my pores or blackheads. One thing that it's good for is that it's very soothing and leaves a cooling feeling when you put it on. That's why I like to use it after exfoliating or when I've had a little too much sun. On the flip side, it seems to soften my skin a little, but not that it's a must.",0
I read the reviews of RAVE about this product. I have a very dry but acne-prone skin. I am on Accutane just because of my acne as my skin is dry and red. I hoped that this product would a) soothe my skin and b) hydrate. Neither has happened.,0
This is a perfect example of a product that is visually appealing but does nothing.,0
I definitely don't have sensitive skin and I decided to try this and as soon as I put it on my face it started to tingle and burn.,0
"I don't think my skin has improved as a result. I didn't feel any moisturizing effect, I let it work overnight and I woke up with quite dry skin!",0
"This felt cool on the skin, but did not contribute to hydration, pustules or soothing. Do not waste your money, buy aloe.",0
I didn't really feel that this product did anything... except maybe a few bumps on my cheeks.,0
"Usually I am satisfied with Dr. Gross products, but this cleanser does nothing for me except smear make-up. No one in the USA is really upset about the foaming cleanser anymore.",0
"I have moderately dry skin. and the only reason I got this cleanser is because it has 3 cleansing tones at the same time, but the instructions tell me to apply it to a dry face with dry hands.... it doesn't foam, it doesn't make me feel clean like a cleanser. I couldn't return it because I threw the box away.",0
It made my skin really dry and I had to apply twice as much serum and moisture to fix the dryness... I finally brought the product back.,0
I am a skincare junkie and I own so many cleaners. The worst thing about this cleanser is that it did not remove my foundation at all and made my face dirty and rough so I had to go in with another cleanser. Don't buy it!!,0
"I have dry combo skin and was looking for something to help me with this, in addition to my hormonal breakouts. Unfortunately, this did not really help me to moisturise my dry skin, and it did not take off my make-up particularly well - you definitely need to clean or use microcellular water first. I also thought I could get used to it not making my skin look squeaky clean, but I just couldn't. It will come back, but I still love Dr. DG:)",0
"I bought this cleansing foam after trying Dr. Dennis Gross All-in-One cleansing foam, but this cleansing foam did nothing for me. It dried out my skin (I have combination skin) and left a very rough feeling. I used it for weeks without realizing that it was the cleanser that did it to my skin until I switched back to the cleansing foam and noticed a huge difference.",0
"I'm sorry, but that's not my thing. It's expensive and I don't see any difference in my skin. It's also very uncomfortable to put it on a dry face.",0
"It pierces my eyes slightly and does NOT remove make-up nearly as well as she claimed. I do not use any facial cleanser to cleanse my eyes except cleansing oil. Well, that would be a total mess. I have other cleaners that I like much better for less $$. If I do not use cleansing oil at first, I feel like I have to clean twice with it. At least my dishcloth tells me that.",0
"I bought this because of the high ratings and because I love a moisturiser from the same brand. I didn't get the same results as others - it leaves parts of my (non-waterproof) eyeliner and mascara like stains. It's good it doesn't dry, but there are better products out there for me, and definitely cheaper. I wouldn't spend my money on it again.",0
I'm a firm believer in using an oil treatment as a moisturiser. I bought one of the Sepora packs that contained this product. I think it's just fine. I think there are other more effective oils. It's minimally moisturising and I wasn't really impressed with the overall product. I wouldn't buy again.,0
"Although it has a pleasant smell and feels very pleasant to use, it leaves an oily sheen. At first I thought I was applying too much of the product, so I decided to apply just one drop to my whole face... Nevertheless, I looked oily all day. I thought I was paranoid until a member of staff came up to me and said, ""Darling, you look a little oily today, I have some powder if you want to use it."" That was the day I only used one drop! Yes, I tried to apply foundation and powder over this oil to reduce the sheen, but I found that the oil seemed to break my foundation during the day and at the end of the day I barely had any foundation left and my setting powder seemed to get stuck in my pores. I experimented with this oil for several days and each time I experienced similar results. Although I think it is a well-formulated oil, and I can't really enjoy the process of applying it because it's a shame.",0
"Don't be fooled! Just because it's supposed to be for sensitive skin types doesn't mean it's really for sensitive skin. Although I still get acne, I'm more susceptible to rosacea breakouts, which were under control thanks to Sephora's renewing serum (which is no longer available... boo!: ()), but I had to find something new. I read reviews and eventually decided on this product.",0
"I have been trying this oil for a little over a week and the scent stopped me immediately, but I thought if the product was really wonderful, I might overlook that fact. To me, it smells really strong and very similar to this fake banana candy scent. Not very pleasant to my nose and not soothing or natural. In the first few days, I thought the texture of my face was improving. After it was soaked and my face felt velvety, there was no oil residue on my face. As the days went by, I noticed that my face looked duller and worse than normal and now had large patchy dry patches on my forehead and breakouts around my nose, cheeks and chin. This will be my first return to Sephora.",0
"My skin is very sensitive, oily in the T-zone, prone to clogged pores and breakouts, so I had high hopes that this would be my moisturizing solution. I used it for 5 days and each time new pimples appeared during the day. My face is a pimple mess. Besides, the oil is NOT absorbed well, but sits on my skin all day making my forehead look like a layer of grease. The smell is divine, but that's the only part I love. I will return to my nude oil, which is thicker but absorbed into my skin and does not break out.",0
"I tried this oil because a beautician suggested I try it. She said it had ""transformed"" her own skin. My skin is SO dry after that harsh winter and I'm breaking out as a result. The beautician said that the dillo oil basically caused my sebaceous glands to stop producing oil and therefore reduce breakouts. I tried it for a week and it really had no effect on my skin. My skin is so dry that after washing and drying my face my skin feels so tight as if I had put on a dried clay mask - I was hoping that this oil would help, but it made my skin, well... oily. It didn't seem to absorb at all, and that's why my make-up didn't go over it well at all. It didn't let me break out at all, it just didn't help. I think it would probably work well for someone whose skin isn't as dry as mine.",0
I bought these products because of the enthusiastic reviews. I did not have the same experience. The oils absorbed well on my skin and I feel that the product is overpriced. I will not be a regular customer.,0
"The instructions for use for this product say to use 2-3 drops per application, but with the design of the applicator it is impossible to use only so much. I tried carefully each time to use the product only to a small amount, yet the dropper would not allow this and I would end up using 5-10 times as much and wasting a lot of product. I had no chance to evaluate the effectiveness of the product because I could not work with the dispenser.",0
"I have normal to dry skin and struggle with dry patches. I had read people who evaluated the product and said it had caused their skin to dry (I always feel that people are sometimes dramatic and critical), so I went to the positive reviews.",0
I bought this because the acne medication my dermatologist had prescribed to me dehydrated my normally normal face. It doesn't feel like it really does anything. I still have dry patches and for nearly $50 I was expecting more.,0
"I had a sample of it that I could use about 10-15 times. I reached for it when my skin felt a little drier. As winter rolled in, I decided to get the full size, but I'm almost done with the tube and I'm not going to buy it back. It didn't really help hydrate my skin and led to some breakouts in the last couple of weeks. Another disappointing thing is that the outside of the tube peels off like peeling paint. I'm surprised that a brand like this would have this design flaw. Disappointed, it didn't work for me in the long run, but it sounds like it works for a lot of other people!",0
"I love this cream. It is thick, but not too thick, very moisturizing. I also like the slight scent of medicinal herbs. However, I hate the packaging! The tube is made of metal and hard to tear off, even though there is a lot left. Besides, the paint splinters off the label and penetrates my face and my vanity. I will not buy it back, despite my love for the product. The packaging has really ruined it for me. I tried it for the first time as a 100-point candy and the packaging was fine there, it will be the only time I try it again in the future. Very disappointing.",0
"I put it on at night and wake up with dry, tense skin. I put it on again this morning and I can barely move my face because my skin feels so tense. Not for people with very dry skin!!!!!",0
"I did not like this product, did not like the smell and made my skin very oily",0
"I think this product is really effective for some because I've heard great reviews in the past, but it didn't work for me. The smell was very strong, and I broke out really bad after using it. That means it could be just me, or something in the product that didn't suit my skin. However, before you spend the big bucks, try a sample!",0
I tried this on my very sensitive skin when I was looking for a moisturiser. I'm sorry to say that the smell overwhelmed me (I always got a strange smell of fish) and I just couldn't use it (made it to the third day).,0
"s sunscreen and it worked well for me. However, I just did not understand the purpose. It felt too thick and oily on my face, but it did not moisturise my body / feet enough. I will not buy the full size.",0
"I have extremely dry skin, not flaky, but the face feels tense immediately after washing and needs to be replenished at noon. I used this cream together with the Ceramidin lotion, but unfortunately this combination was not moisturizing enough for me.",0
"I tend to break out every time I try it, wanted it to work, but it doesn't. I'll just use it as a lotion for my body.",0
The smell of it is so bad that I could hardly wait to wash it off!!! Smells very strongly of menthol or medicine!!,0
yuck- smells so strong of dead roses!!! yuck- had to wash off,0
I loved it at first because my face was so dry. I only wore this orange on my face and it stained not only my face but also my forehead.,0
Break out the next day!,0
"I have very dry skin, so I wanted a moisturizing serum. This is a really big bottle, so it's a lot for the price. But, after trying this for a few months, I just don't think this is the product for me. First of all, the fourth ingredient is alcohol, which is strange considering that it's supposed to be a moisturizing product. Besides, it leaves a very shiny face, so I don't like to use it in the mornings. I also think that it causes some breakouts. When I first tried it, I noticed clogged pores and bumpy skin texture along my cheeks, and some small pimples that appear. I listened to it and my face got better, but because it was such an expensive product, I gave it again. The clogged pores and bumps returned. They're not too noticeable, so I could use it to the end, but I'll never use it again, mainly because there are so many cheaper and better moisturizing ones out there.",0
She swore it was a holy grail product. I tried it for three weeks and noticed absolutely nothing. I gave it back. I honestly felt it was just a bottle filled with murky water.,0
Rec'd use this as a sample and was not impressed. Leaves my dry skin itchy and read. Has no moisture at all. Would not buy this product.,0
"It smelled terrible, so I couldn't even use it long enough to see if it was moisturising and repairing.",0
"I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, it irritated and dried out my skin, I think, because of the high alcohol content.",0
"I have extremely dry skin, not flaky, but the face feels tense immediately after washing and needs to be replenished at noon. I used this product together with the Ceramidin cream, but unfortunately this combination was not moisturizing enough for me.",0
"Didn't do any damage or break me, but saw almost no results. Followed by a ceramidin cream and saw no difference between the cream alone and when I used it with the additional Dr. Jart + layer underneath.",0
"t have a particularly dry skin, so I got it as a light moisturiser. I was underpowered. It left a kind of sticky and almost oily skin, but the smell was pleasant.",0
"I'm sure it works for some people, but I couldn't get past the smell, I had to wash my face and hands several times to get rid of the odor. Conclusion: If you're sensitive to odor at all, make sure you do a sniff test before buying.",0
"I have had this for a few months and I am here to report that it does nothing. It is basically thick water. It does nothing for my skin at all. Nothing. And if you get a bit on your lips, it tastes terrible.",0
"Wanted to love him because he made great demands, but he irritated my skin! I thought he denatured alcohol, so not good for sensitive skin!",0
"I have sensitive and dry skin. I used it for the first time with a Koh-Gen-Do cream and it was too hard. It didn't seem to be hydrated, in fact my chin still had dry spots and my face was oily in the middle of the day. I wanted it to work so badly because of the good reviews and the price, so I gave her two more tries, but stopped when she gave me three big pimples. I tried the Koh-Gen-Do cream alone and my skin got so much better.",0
"I had high hopes after reading the reviews, and I love it, but it made me break out on the chin. I never have breakouts on the chin, so I knew it was the fluid that caused it. If it didn't break me out, it would be an amazing product.",0
"After the first application my skin started to sting and burn, but I kept using it because I really wanted it to work because I paid so much for it and it worked amazingly for my mother, but instead I got ALL red bumps on my face and it took over a week to go away. I do not recommend this for extremely dry sensitive skin.",0
"I have fine lines under the eyes, and I have noticed no visible tightening at all. It feels like any other basic eye cream, and you definitely don't have to spend $80 on it.",0
"I love the cream version, but I really can't see that this liquid has done anything for my dry skin at all. Mine wasn't thick or rich, as others have said, mine was very watery and didn't even feel moisturizing the first time I applied it. It just felt like... well... water? I'll definitely keep using the cream, but for me this liquid isn't worth the extra step (though it's cheap).",0
"I really wanted to like it because I have super sensitive skin prone to acne, but it really didn't do anything on my face except make it super greasy, so I gave it to a friend.",0
"I think I'm in the minority here, but I hated this product. It broke out of me! I had little bumps on my cheeks. I hated the consistency. I have oily skin / combo skin and that definitely didn't moisturise me, it actually felt sticky on my skin. I can't imagine how someone with dry skin would like that. I'm a bit surprised by all the glowing reviews and wonder if I got a dud. I'll give that back for something more moisturizing.",0
"Save $90.00 and invest in another moisturizer. If you are hoping to buy a moisturizer that will visibly improve your skin, it will disappoint me. After 3 months of use, I see no difference.",0
"I don't see any difference in my skin after using it for 2 months. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who raved about it, but I don't think it brings me anything. I won't buy it again (mainly because there are some amazing brands at a lower price that can do the same), nor do I think it moisturizes me as well.",0
In my opinion not worth the dollar. I think it broke out for me. I really didn't like the smell. I didn't see great results either.,0
I wouldn't consider myself a sensitive skin or a guy checking a product. I tried this on the recommendation of a super-friendly and seemingly knowledgeable member of staff. It went crazy. I couldn't figure out why I got small pimples on my face. I started applying in certain areas and the other areas cleared up. Super disappointed. Don't spend good money on it. I didn't do anything for my fine lines and it broke out. Two thumbs down.,0
"I was always happy with the recommendations from Sephora staff, but on my last visit, a representative of Kate Somerville was in Sephora and really put me under pressure to try it. They were in front of the brand that I normally buy, so I thought it couldn't be so much different from my usual brand and it costs less. It doesn't moisturise or soothe dark spots. I was able to overcome the smell, but my nose peeled badly with this cream. If I didn't live that far from a Sephora, I would give it back. I've used various high quality moisturising creams that I like better than others. I don't usually write reviews, but a product that is that expensive should be better.",0
"This product broke my skin almost immediately. I have extremely sensitive skin, which is also dry, and a Sephora employee recommended this. I would not recommend it to anyone with skin similar to mine. I gave it back for a refund.",0
"My forehead is now floating in bumps that have never been my problem. Thank God for the other reviewer who pointed out the reaction of her sensitive skin. My skin is sensitive, isn't it? I have tried many products and used them successfully.",0
"The girl who sold me it said it was THE BEST product for dark spots... WRONG! Not only did it not work, I ran out in a little over a month! I used a pump every time, so it's not like I used too much. There's no SPF in it either. I took the pump apart to see if I couldn't scrape it out anymore (you don't know your bottom until it's gone because there's no way to look inward), and the actual part that contains the moisturizer is much smaller than the packaging! The outside is very deceptive! Bottom line, if you're going to spend $90 on a moisturizer, don't buy it!",0
"I bought this after a demonstration in the store. I should have stuck to my instinct that this might not be the best ""moisturiser"" for me when the employee said that they were proposing not just 1 serum before application, but 2, i.e. a pre-serum and then a serum. Seriously, within 24 hours I could find that I was feeling drier than usual and within 48 hours my forehead was flaky, a problem I hadn't had for 25 years. To make matters worse, there were slight breakouts in my chin and nose area. I used the product only two days and two weeks later the situation calmed down.",0
"What a terrible disappointment this cream is. I bought it believing that its statement ""this product is clinically tested to be safe for sensitive skin"" was actually true. This product caused unpleasant breakouts in the chin and jaw area. It has been over 2 weeks since I stopped using the cream and the breakouts have not yet been fully cleared up. Do not waste your money if you have sensitive skin!",0
"One of the worst anti-aging creams I've ever used. It's pure scrap. It made my skin so lifeless, grey, boring and just terrible.... DO NOT BUY.",0
"I was persuaded by a saleswoman in a Sephora store to buy this cream and it was horrible. I bought it on Thursday afternoon, used it that night and the next morning and 24 hours later my skin came off my face! I had been told it was for sensitive skin and I could even apply it around my eyes! Glad I didn't listen! And when I wanted to return it two days later, another salesman contacted me as if it was my fault for having bought a cream that wasn't meant for ""young skin."" I couldn't even believe it!",0
"I have a combo skin that is neither sensitive nor dry. In general, I would like to like Shiseido as it was the first brand I ever used (I enjoy some of its serums / moisturizers), but it was too intense as a cleanser. It is foaming and foaming well, but it claims to be ""gentle..."" it actually drains moisture from the skin.",0
"I have oily skin, but these products make my skin feel dry and tight, even though they are supposed to be gentle. It doesn't cleanse very well. I still have a lot of make-up residue on my face.",0
"I went looking for a cleanser that would foam with my Clarasonic and be gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Normally, my skin is pretty clear. I may have a small cluster here and there, but nothing since this product. I tried to find out if it was something I ate or what. I am convinced that it is this cleanser. I have now erupted my entire face. I do not recommend this product to anyone.",0
"I had used the Lancé'me Pure Gel Focus and it worked pretty well without causing redness or dandruff, but I wanted something thicker to clean my large pores and help avoid forehead spots, which foamed twice as much as the Lancé with my Clarisonic treatment and didn't make my skin too tight, but my nose and mouth started to turn red and flaky. I tried to use it every other day at night, but my skin still reacted too much to it, even with my Origins moisturizer. I will use it again for my Lancé'me.",0
Pro-Need only the smallest amount to cover your face.,0
"This turns out to be a big disappointment, Shiseido's things are usually quite mild and moisturizing, I rely on Japanese lines that are more oriented towards the Asian market), but I find this detergent incredibly drying and not at all effective, can not even wash off the floor stain on the bottle after several attempts.",0
Pro: Value... Only one pea size is enough to produce a nice foam.,0
"I got a sample from Sephora this product is a waste of time, my skin felt dry, dehydrated and itchy, I also noticed that it did not remove my makeup and it burned my skin under my chin it was horrible also felt like I had a lot of soap residues in my skin like a nasty film of soap foam coarse will never try again!",0
"I thought it was a primer for the face, so I bought it as such. I then realized it was part of a system. Well, I still use it. I put it in front of my foundation and it seems to work just as well as a primer.",0
